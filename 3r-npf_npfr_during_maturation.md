## NPF-NPFR signaling sensitizes ab3A neurons as adult females mature

As mentioned earlier, Or22a-expressing ab3A neurons are actively sensitized during the early maturation period for about three days.
Male and female flies show sexually dimorphic difference in ab3A neuron's sensitivity on the first day after eclosion, but eventually both are fully sensitized in three days (Fig 4A).
However, both male and female flies with NPFR mutation, in which NPF-NPFR signaling is blocked, show failure in sensitization for ab3A neurons (Fig 4A).
This result demonstrate that the sensitization process for ab3A neurons during the early maturation period is mediated by NPF-NPFR signaling.
Sexually dimorphic sensitivity of ab3A neurons, by the way, can be explained by different level of NPF production in the brain.
The immunostaining and the quantified result show that NPF is more actively produced in the male brains (Fig 4B, C).
