## NPF-NPFR signaling sensitizes ab3A neurons as adult flies mature

In early maturation period after eclosion, a male and a female show significantly different rates of sensitization in ab3A neurons (Fig. 1C). We wondered if this sexual dimorphism is driven by different level of NPF signal. As expected, NPF immunostaining results showed that significantly different level of NPF in the brains between males and females after about 24 hours of eclosion (Fig. 3A, B). In addition, NPFR mutant flies showed failure in sensitizing ab3A neurons in early maturation period after eclosion (Fig. 3C). This result demonstrate that the sensitization process for ab3A neurons during the early maturation period is mediated by NPF-NPFR signaling.
