## NPFR in ab3A neurons modulates olfactory-guided behavior

We next asked whether NPF-NPFR signaling in the ab3A neurons modulates olfactory guided-behaviors.
Trap assays are often used to test olfactory function at the behavioral level \cite{Park_2002}, but they can produce fairly noisy data (data not shown).
Since social cues modulate olfactory behavior in flies \cite{Ramdya_2014}, we designed a new trap assay for individual flies (Fig 5A) hoping to measure olfactory attraction at a higher signal-to-noise ratio.
The single fly olfactory trap assay comprises an origin chamber and a bait chamber connected by a narrow length of plastic tubing only slightly wider than an individual fly.
Although the origin chambers contain wet tissue as a water source, there is no food.
At first, the individual flies in the origin chamber resist traveling through the narrow tube, but as they starve over the course of the assay, the odor source lures them into the adjoining bait chamber.
To perform the assay, we habituate individual 7--10 day-old male flies in vials containing a tissue soaked with fresh apple juice. 
After assembling the traps, we place them in a dark 25 Â°C incubator for 40 hours.
From 40--50 hours, we check the traps every 2 hours removing and counting "successes" in which the individual flies travel to the bait chamber.
We chose fresh apple juice (10^-1^ v/v) as a bait because it provides a source of sugar and has induces a similar olfactory response in the OSNs of large basiconic sensilla as ethyl butyrate (10^-4^ v/v) (Fig 5B). 

To confirm our single fly trap assay measures olfactory attraction, we performed some initial control experiments.
While more than 70% of _w^1118^_ flies move to bait chambers containing apple juice, no flies move when the origin chamber contains the apple juice (Fig 5C).
If both chambers contain water, fewer than 20% of _w^1118^_ flies cross to the bait chamber within 50 hours.
In addition, with _Orco^1^_ flies, whose large basiconic sensilla are non-functional, fewer than 30% locate the apple juice bait.
These results validate the single fly trap assay for measuring olfactory-guided attraction to fruit odor.

Next we wondered if the fly's attraction behavior to apple juice is solely mediated by the ethyl butyrate-sensitive ab3A neurons.
To address this question, we used the ab3A neuron-specific Or22a-down-regulated flies, which have desensitized ab3A neurons.
Surprisingly, These flies showed loss of foraging ability in the assay (Fig 5C).
This result suggest that a fly's attraction behavior to fruits releasing ethyl butyrate is solely mediated by ab3A neurons.

Finally, we tested the flies with specific knock-down of NPFR in the ORNs or in the ab3A neurons.
Surprisingly, knock-down of NPFR in the ORNs by Orco-Gal4 significantly reduced the fly's foraging ability (Fig 5D).
Furthermore, Or22a neuron-specific knock-down of NPFR significantly reduced the foraging ability of the flies as well.
These results show that NPF-NPFR signaling for ab3A neurons is not only sensitizing the neuronal sensitivity to fruit odor but also eventually enhancing the fly's ability for finding food sources.
