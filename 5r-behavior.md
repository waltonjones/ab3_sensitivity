## NPFR in ab3A neurons modulates olfactory-guided behavior

We next asked whether NPF-NPFR signaling in the ab3A neurons modulates olfactory guided-behaviors.
Trap assays are often used to test olfactory function at the behavioral level \cite{Park_2002}, but they can produce fairly noisy data (data not shown).
Since social cues modulate olfactory behavior in flies \cite{Ramdya_2014}, we designed a new trap assay for individual flies (Fig. 5A) hoping to measure olfactory attraction at a higher signal-to-noise ratio.
The single fly olfactory trap assay comprises an origin chamber and a bait chamber connected by a narrow length of plastic tubing only slightly wider than an individual fly.
Although the origin chambers contain wet tissue as a water source, there is no food.
At first, the individual flies in the origin chamber resist traveling through the narrow tube, but as they starve over the course of the assay, the odor source lures them into the adjoining bait chamber.
To perform the assay, we habituate individual 7--10 day-old male flies in vials containing a tissue soaked with fresh apple juice. 
After assembling the traps, we place them in a dark 25 Â°C incubator for 40 hours.
From 40--50 hours, we check the traps every 2 hours removing and counting "successes" in which the individual flies travel to the bait chamber.
We chose fresh apple juice (10^-1^ v/v) as a bait because it provides a source of sugar and has induces a similar olfactory response in the OSNs of large basiconic sensilla as ethyl butyrate (10^-4^ v/v) (Fig. 5B). 

To confirm our single fly trap assay measures olfactory attraction, we performed some initial control experiments.
We found that more than 70% of _w^1118^_ flies successfully reach bait chambers containing apple juice, but they never leave the origin chamber when it contains the apple juice rather than the bait chamber (Fig. 5C).
If both chambers contain water, fewer than 20% of _w^1118^_ flies cross to the bait chamber within 50 hours.
Since _Orco^1^_ flies lack the olfactory co-receptor Orco, which is required for OR trafficking, their OR-expressing OSNs are non-functional \cite{Larsson_2004}.
We found fewer than 30% of _Orco^1^_ flies locate the apple juice bait.
These results validate the single fly trap assay for measuring olfactory-guided attraction to fruit odor.

Since ethyl butyrate is a major component of apple odor, we next asked whether Or22a---the odorant receptor expressed in the ethyl butyrate-sensitive ab3A neurons---is required for behavioral attraction to apple juice.
We found ab3A-specific knock-down of Or22a using _Or22a-GAL4_ dramatically reduces attraction to apple juice in the trap assay (Fig. 5C).
This result suggested NPF-NPFR signaling may also modulate behavioral attraction to apple odor.
Indeed, knock-down of NPFR in most olfactory neurons using _Orco-GAL4_ and in the ab3A neurons alone using _Or22a-GAL4_ both significantly reduce success in locating the apple juice bait (Fig. 5D).
Together, these results suggest the role of NPF-NPFR signaling in modulating the peripheral sensitivity of the ab3A neurons is behaviorally relevant for olfactory-guided foraging.
