## Specific knock-down of NPFR in OR22a neurons disrupts fly's behavioral attraction to apple juice odor

Finally, we tested the importance of NPF-NPFR signaling for Or22a neurons in flies' foraging behavior.
One of the conventional methods which have been used for testing flies' attraction behavior is the trap-assay \cite{Park_2002}.
However, testing flies' behavior in group often produces confusing results, probably because of the behavioral interferences caused by other flies, masking the effects of the tested odorants \cite{Ramdya_2014}.
To address this problem, we designed new assay for single fly's attraction behavior (Fig 4-A).
This assay is composed of the two chambers.
A single fly is introduced into the bigger chamber with water-wet Kimwipes, and by a narrow tube, the bigger chamber is connected to the smaller chamber with diluted apple juice.
The assays are kept in the dark room, then the number of the flies that moved into the apple juice chamber is counted and quantified.

We first examined if this assay is usable for testing olfactory attraction behavior.
After about 40 hours in the dark room, 96% of the wild-type flies moved into the apple juice chamber.
On the other hand, less than 27% of the wild-type flies moved into the chamber with distilled water.
In addition, as expected, Orco1 mutant flies which have no functional ORNs could not locate the apple juice (Fig 4-B).
Next we tested the flies that NPFR is specifically down-regulated in ORNs or in Or22a neurons.
Surprisingly, NPFR down-regulation in ORNs by Orco-Gal4 dramatically reduced the flies' success rate of finding the apple juice (Fig 4-C).
Furthermore, Or22a neuron-specifically down-regulation of NPFR significantly reduced the success rate as well (Fig 4-D).
These results suggest that NPF-NPFR signaling for Or22a neurons eventually modulate the flies' behavioral attraction towards food source.
