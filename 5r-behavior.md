## Specific knock-down of NPFR in the ab3A neurons disrupts fly's foraging ability for fruits with a sweet-odor

Finally, we tried to verify the importance of NPF-NPFR signaling for a fly’s foraging ability. One of the conventional methods which have been used for testing fly’s attraction behavior is the trap-assay \cite{Park_2002}. However, testing a behavior of the flies in group often produces confusing results because of the behavioral interferences caused by other flies, masking the effects of the tested cues \cite{Ramdya_2014}. To address this problem, we designed new assay for testing single fly's attraction behavior (Fig 6-A). This assay is composed of the two chambers. A single fly is introduced into the “origin chamber” containing wet Kimwipes. And by a narrow tube, the “origin chamber” is connected to the “bait chamber” containing an odorous bait. The assay settings were kept in the dark room, then after a while, the number of the flies that moved into the apple juice-containing “bait chamber” was counted for quantification.

For a bait, we used diluted fresh apple juice, which showed very similar response profile to ethyl butyrate by fly’s antennal large basiconic ORNs (Fig 6-B).

We first examined if this assay is usable for testing olfactory attraction behavior.
After about 40 hours in the dark room, 96% of the wild-type flies moved into the apple juice chamber.
On the other hand, less than 27% of the wild-type flies moved into the chamber with distilled water.
In addition, as expected, Orco1 mutant flies which have no functional ORNs could not locate the apple juice (Fig 4-B).
Next we tested the flies that NPFR is specifically down-regulated in ORNs or in Or22a neurons.
Surprisingly, NPFR down-regulation in ORNs by Orco-Gal4 dramatically reduced the flies' success rate of finding the apple juice (Fig 4-C).
Furthermore, Or22a neuron-specifically down-regulation of NPFR significantly reduced the success rate as well (Fig 4-D).
These results suggest that NPF-NPFR signaling for Or22a neurons eventually modulate the flies' behavioral attraction towards food source.
