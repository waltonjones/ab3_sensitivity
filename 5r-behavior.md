## Specific knock-down of NPFR in the ab3A neurons disrupts fly's foraging ability for fruits with a sweet-odor

We also tried to verify the importance of NPF-NPFR signaling for a fly’s foraging ability. One of the conventional methods which have been used for testing fly’s attraction behavior is the trap-assay \cite{Park_2002}. However, testing a behavior of the flies in group often produces confusing results because of the behavioral interferences caused by other flies, masking the effects of the tested cues \cite{Ramdya_2014}. To address this problem, we have designed new assay for testing single fly's attraction behavior (Fig 6-A). As illustrated, a single fly is introduced into the “origin chamber” containing wet Kimwipes. And through a narrow tube, the fly can move into the “bait chamber” which contains an odorous bait. For a bait, we used fresh apple juice which showed very similar response profile to ethyl butyrate by fly’s antennal large basiconic ORNs (Fig 6-B). 

We first examined this assay to make sure that this setting is valid for testing fly’s attraction behavior. As expected, in the dark, more than 70% of the w1118 flies moved into the “bait chamber” containing apple juice (Fig 6-C). On the other hand, less than 20% of the w1118 flies moved into the “bait chamber” when it contains distilled water. In addition, less than 30% of the Orco1 mutant flies which have no functional ORNs could locate the apple juice bait. This result demonstrate that this new assay setting is valid for testing ORN-mediated fly’s attraction to fruit odor..

Next we wondered if the fly’s attraction behavior to apple juice is solely mediated by the ethyl butyrate-sensitive ab3A neurons. To address this question, we used the ab3A neuron-specific Or22a-down-regulated flies, which have desensitized ab3A neurons. Surprisingly, These flies showed loss of foraging ability in the assay (Fig 6-C). This result suggest that a fly's attraction behavior to fruits releasing ethyl butyrate is solely mediated by ab3A neurons.

Finally, 

We first examined if this assay is usable for testing olfactory attraction behavior.
After about 40 hours in the dark room, 96% of the wild-type flies moved into the apple juice chamber.
On the other hand, less than 27% of the wild-type flies moved into the chamber with distilled water.
In addition, as expected, Orco1 mutant flies which have no functional ORNs could not locate the apple juice (Fig 4-B).
Next we tested the flies that NPFR is specifically down-regulated in ORNs or in Or22a neurons.
Surprisingly, NPFR down-regulation in ORNs by Orco-Gal4 dramatically reduced the flies' success rate of finding the apple juice (Fig 4-C).
Furthermore, Or22a neuron-specifically down-regulation of NPFR significantly reduced the success rate as well (Fig 4-D).
These results suggest that NPF-NPFR signaling for Or22a neurons eventually modulate the flies' behavioral attraction towards food source.
