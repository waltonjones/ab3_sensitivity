## Specific knock-down of NPFR in the ab3A neurons disrupts fly's foraging ability for fruits with a sweet-odor

We also tried to verify the importance of NPF-NPFR signaling for a fly's foraging ability. One of the conventional methods which have been used for testing fly's attraction behavior is the trap-assay \cite{Park_2002}. However, testing a behavior of the flies in group often produces confusing results because of the behavioral interferences caused by other flies, masking the effects of the tested cues \cite{Ramdya_2014}. To address this problem, we have designed new assay for testing single fly's attraction behavior (Fig 6-A). As illustrated, a single fly is introduced into the "origin chamber" containing wet Kimwipes. And through a narrow tube, the fly can move into the "bait chamber" which contains an odorous bait. For a bait, we used fresh apple juice which showed very similar response profile to ethyl butyrate by fly's antennal large basiconic ORNs (Fig 6-B). 

We first examined this assay to make sure that this setting is valid for testing fly's attraction behavior. As expected, in the dark, more than 70% of the w1118 flies moved into the "bait chamber" containing apple juice (Fig 6-C). On the other hand, less than 20% of the w1118 flies moved into the "bait chamber" when it contains distilled water. In addition, less than 30% of the Orco1 mutant flies which have no functional ORNs could locate the apple juice bait. This result demonstrate that this new assay setting is valid for testing ORN-mediated fly's attraction to fruit odor.

Next we wondered if the fly's attraction behavior to apple juice is solely mediated by the ethyl butyrate-sensitive ab3A neurons. To address this question, we used the ab3A neuron-specific Or22a-down-regulated flies, which have desensitized ab3A neurons. Surprisingly, These flies showed loss of foraging ability in the assay (Fig 6-C). This result suggest that a fly's attraction behavior to fruits releasing ethyl butyrate is solely mediated by ab3A neurons.

Finally, we tested the flies with specific knock-down of NPFR in the ORNs or in the ab3A neurons. Surprisingly, knock-down of NPFR in the ORNs by Orco-Gal4 significantly reduced the fly's foraging ability (Fig 6-D). Furthermore, Or22a neuron-specific knock-down of NPFR significantly reduced the foraging ability of the flies as well. These results show that NPF-NPFR signaling for ab3A neurons is not only sensitizing the neuronal sensitivity to fruit odor but also eventually enhancing the fly's ability for finding food sources.
