## NPFR in ab3A neurons modulates behavioral attraction to fruit odor

We also tried to verify the importance of NPF-NPFR signaling for a fly's foraging ability.
One of the conventional methods which have been used for testing fly's attraction behavior is the trap-assay \cite{Park_2002}.
However, testing a behavior of the flies in group often produces confusing results because of the behavioral interferences caused by other flies, masking the effects of the tested cues \cite{Ramdya_2014}.
To address this problem, we have designed new assay for testing single fly's attraction behavior (Fig 5A).
As illustrated, a single fly is introduced into the "origin chamber" containing wet Kimwipes.
And through a narrow tube, the fly can move into the "bait chamber" which contains an odorous bait.
For a bait, we used fresh apple juice which showed very similar response profile to ethyl butyrate by fly's antennal large basiconic ORNs (Fig 5B). 

We first examined this assay to make sure that this setting is valid for testing fly's attraction behavior.
As expected, in the dark, more than 70% of the w1118 flies moved into the "bait chamber" containing apple juice (Fig 5C).
On the other hand, less than 20% of the w1118 flies moved into the "bait chamber" when it contains distilled water.
In addition, less than 30% of the Orco1 mutant flies which have no functional ORNs could locate the apple juice bait.
This result demonstrate that this new assay setting is valid for testing ORN-mediated fly's attraction to fruit odor.

Next we wondered if the fly's attraction behavior to apple juice is solely mediated by the ethyl butyrate-sensitive ab3A neurons.
To address this question, we used the ab3A neuron-specific Or22a-down-regulated flies, which have desensitized ab3A neurons.
Surprisingly, These flies showed loss of foraging ability in the assay (Fig 5C).
This result suggest that a fly's attraction behavior to fruits releasing ethyl butyrate is solely mediated by ab3A neurons.

Finally, we tested the flies with specific knock-down of NPFR in the ORNs or in the ab3A neurons.
Surprisingly, knock-down of NPFR in the ORNs by Orco-Gal4 significantly reduced the fly's foraging ability (Fig 5D).
Furthermore, Or22a neuron-specific knock-down of NPFR significantly reduced the foraging ability of the flies as well.
These results show that NPF-NPFR signaling for ab3A neurons is not only sensitizing the neuronal sensitivity to fruit odor but also eventually enhancing the fly's ability for finding food sources.
