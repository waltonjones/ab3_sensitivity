# Discussion

Drosophila NPF is known to be a functional analog of mammalian NPY \cite{Brown_1999} \cite{Wu_2003}.
In mammalian system, NPY production is negatively regulated by high level of insulin and leptin \cite{Figlewicz_2008}.
Although flies do not have leptin, they express Upd2, which is known to be a functional analog of mammalian leptin \cite{Rajan_2012}.
Flies also express eight different types of insulin-like peptides (dIlps) and one known insulin receptor (dInR) \cite{Fernandez_Almonacid_1987}. 

NPFR identification \cite{Garczynski_2002}

they have several different types of insulin-like peptides (DILPs) \cite{Arquier_2008}, which may inhibit NPF production.
DILPs also inhibit the expression of sNPF-R which promote the synaptic transmission in the antennal lobe \cite{Root_2011}.
When the flies' internal need of energy increases, DILPs level fall leading to loss of inhibition of NPF production in the NPF neurons and sNPF-R expression in the Or22a neurons.
Working together, NPF and sNPF signaling amplify the olfactory signal to the higher brain centers and increase the food-searching ability of the flies.

NPF-NPFR signaling is also regulating other sensory neurons like gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) as well.
Drosophila 3rd instar larvae normally show sugar aversion behavior before pupation.
However, when NPF is over-expressed, their aversive behavior to sugar is suppressed \cite{Wu_2003}.
In fact, high level of NPF stimulate dopamine production, in turn, lead to enhanced sugar sensitivity of Gr5a neurons \cite{Inagaki_2014}.
Taken together, NPF-NPFR signaling seems to be used for sensitizing multiple types of sensory neurons related to searching food when needed.
