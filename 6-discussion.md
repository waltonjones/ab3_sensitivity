Our study demonstrate a previously unknown NPF-NPFR mediated olfactory sensitization mechanism which plays a role in helping fly’s foraging ability for fruits - natural sugar sources. Fruit flies are highly attracted to sugar which is contained in various fruits in nature. Although the various kinds of sugars are not volatile, flies can detect those fruits at a distance because of fruit aroma that is produced and diffused by the fruits. Fruit flies use these fruity odors to navigate and locate the fruits which are necessary for them to refuel their body and survive. Whether the correlation between fruit aroma and sucrose source in the fly’s nervous system is fully encoded in their genome or if it is partially obtained by learning is unclear yet.

Although a fly’s olfactory receptor neurons are ordinarily very sensitive, they must be even more sensitized depending on their internal needs. Because, the area of activity of a fly is wide and a sugar-containing food is relatively rare in the natural environment.

When a fly is hungry, the NPF secretion in the fly brain is stimulated, in turn, sugar-sensitive Gr5a neurons are sensitized via dopamine signaling \cite{Inagaki_2014}. Taking together with our study that when NPF-NPFR signaling is activated, it also sensitize the olfactory sensitivity for the major fruit odor ethyl butyrate, NPF seems to be a neuropeptide molecule that is masterminding sugar-related peripheral sensitivity. 

In addition, although the mature peptide sequence of Drosophila NPF and human NPY are poorly identical (19.4%), dNPF and mammalian NPY are known to mediate similar physiological functions for feeding and metabolism \cite{Beck_2001} \cite{Lingo_2007} \cite{Wu_2003} \cite{Wu_2005}. Furthermore, NPY producing cells are inhibited by high level of leptin which are quite similar to the functionally analogous Drosophila Upd2 \cite{Elmquist_1999} \cite{Barb_2006} \cite{Rajan_2012}. Besides, NPY gene expression is inhibited by mammalian insulin \cite{Sato_2005} and there is also insulin like peptides in Drosophila (Dilps). Taken together, our results suggest that NPY signaling may also be involved in sensitizing human olfactory sensitivity for sugar, eventually help stimulating appetite and eating behavior.
