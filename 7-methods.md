# Materials and methods
### Fly stocks
Unless otherwise indicated, we maintained all fly stocks at 25 ºC and 60% relative humidity under a 12h:12h light:dark cycle on standard cornmeal-yeast-corn syrup medium with 1.5 g/L of the anti-fungal Tegosept.
We acquired the following fly stocks from either the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC) or the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center (VDRC) for use in our experiments :  Canton-S (BDSC #1), w<sup>1118</sup> (BDSC #5905), NPF-GAL4 (BDSC #25681), UAS-NPF-IR1 (VDRC #108772), 386Y-GAL4 (BDSC #25410), NPFR<sup>PBac</sup> (BDSC #10747), NPFR<sup>Def</sup> (BDSC #1982), Orco-GAL4 (BDSC #23292), Or22a-GAL4  (BDSC #9951), UAS-NPFR-IR1 (VDRC #9605).

### Electrophysiology
We performed single sensillum electrophysiological recordings by inserting electrolytically sharpened tungsten electrodes into large basiconic sensilla as previously described \cite{Benton_2011ei}. To do so, we used a universal single-ended probe, a data acquisition controller (IDAC4), a CS55 stimulus controller, and the Autospike software supplied by Syntech (Germany).

All odors were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) at the highest purity available and suspended in paraffin oil at the indicated dilutions. Odors were delivered by adding 3 µl of an odor-paraffin oil emulsion to a small piece of filter paper. This was immediately inserted into a standard pasteur pipette. After connecting this odor cartridge to the stimulus controller, we used a pedal-switch to trigger a 0.5 s switch between odorous and non-odorous air streams  to the antennae of a live, restrained fly.

We calculated peak odor-evoked firing rates by counting the spikes occurring in the most action potential-rich 200 ms region within 0.5 s of odor stimulus initiation. After converting this to spikes per second, we subtracted the number of spontaneous action potentials that occurred within a 1 s window before odor delivery.

### Immunohistochemistry
Immunostaining on the whole-mount brains was performed as previously described  [11]. We purchased the rabbit polyclonal anti-NPF antibody from RayBiotech (#RB-19-0001, USA) and used it at a concentration of 50 µg/ml. We purchased the neuropil marker nc82 from the DSHB (USA) and used it at a concentration of 7 µg/ml. We used goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (ab150085) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 594 (A-11005) secondary antibodies from Thermofisher (USA) and used them at a 1:1000 dilution.

### Behavioral analysis
\>10 assay sets for one genotype were prepared as described in (Fig. 6A). The assay sets were kept in a dark room for about 35 hours, after then, started counting the flies moved into the odor-chamber. Once the success rate of any group exceed 80%, the experiment was stopped and quantified and statistically analyzed.
