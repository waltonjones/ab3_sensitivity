# Materials and methods
### Fly stocks
Unless otherwise indicated, we maintained all fly stocks at 25 ºC and 60% relative humidity under a 12h:12h light:dark cycle on standard cornmeal-yeast-corn syrup medium with 1.5 g/L of the anti-fungal Tegosept.
We acquired the following fly stocks from either the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC) or the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center (VDRC) for use in our experiments :  Canton-S (BDSC #1), w<sup>1118</sup> (BDSC #5905), NPF-GAL4 (BDSC #25681), UAS-NPF-IR1 (VDRC #108772), 386Y-GAL4 (BDSC #25410), NPFR<sup>PBac</sup> (BDSC #10747), NPFR<sup>Def</sup> (BDSC #1982), Orco-GAL4 (BDSC #23292), Or22a-GAL4  (BDSC #9951), UAS-NPFR-IR1 (VDRC #9605).

### Electrophysiology
We performed single sensillum electrophysiological recordings by inserting electrolytically sharpened tungsten electrodes into large basiconic sensilla as previously described \cite{Benton_2011ei}.
To do so, we used a universal single-ended probe, a data acquisition controller (IDAC4), a CS55 stimulus controller, and the Autospike software supplied by Syntech (Germany).

All odors were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) at the highest purity available and suspended in paraffin oil at the indicated dilutions.
Odors were delivered by adding 3 µl of an odor-paraffin oil emulsion to a small piece of filter paper.
This was immediately inserted into a standard pasteur pipette.
After connecting this odor cartridge to the stimulus controller, we used a pedal-switch to trigger a 0.5 s switch between odorous and non-odorous air streams  to the antennae of a live, restrained fly.

We calculated peak odor-evoked firing rates by counting the spikes occurring in the most action potential-rich 200 ms region within 0.5 s of odor stimulus initiation.
After converting this to spikes per second, we subtracted the number of spontaneous action potentials that occurred within a 1 s window before odor delivery.

### Immunohistochemistry for fly brains
Immunostaining on the whole-mount brains was performed as previously described \cite{Vosshall_2000}.
We used the rabbit polyclonal anti-NPF antibody (RB-19-0001) from RayBiotech (USA) at a concentration of 50 µg/ml.
We used the neuropil marker nc82 (AB_2314866) from the DSHB (USA) at a concentration of 7 µg/ml.
We used the goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (ab150085) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 594 (A-11005) secondary antibodies from Thermofisher (USA) at a 1:1000 dilution.

### Behavioral analysis
The flies for the behavior assay were aged at least for 5-10 days, habituated to apple juice food for >1 day.
Each fly was introduced into one assay vial as illustrated on figure 6, >10 assay vials for each group were set and kept in dark chamber at 25 degree-centigrade for 40 hours without any vibration.
Since after 40 hours, on a two hour cycle, dark chamber was opened for counting the flies that moved into the odorous "bait chamber".
Once the incubation time reaches to 50 hours, the experiment was stopped and results were calculated for statistics.
Statistical analysis was done by Fisher's exact test which is commonly used for the data composed of two variables.
