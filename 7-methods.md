# Materials and methods

**Drosophila lines**: Canton-S (BDSC #1), w1118 flies (BDSC #5905) were used as the genetic background controls. NPF-Gal4 flies (BDSC #25681) were used to knock-down NPF mRNA along with the UAS-NPF-RNAi (VDRC #108772) flies. 386Y-Gal4 flies (BDSC #25410) were used to knock-down NPF mRNA in the broad range of peptidergic neurons along with UAS-NPF-RNAi (VDRC #108772) flies. NPFRPBac flies (BDSC #10747) were used for testing the sensitivity of Or22a neurons by electrophysiology combined with the NPFR gene-deficient (BDSC #1982) flies. Orco-Gal4 flies (Dieter Wicher's lab) and Or22a-Gal4 flies (BDSC #9951) were used for OSN-specific knock-down of NPFR along with UAS-NPFR-RNAi (VDRC #9605) flies.
Single sensillum electrophysiological recordings: The responses of individual olfactory neurons were recorded with the tungsten microelectrodes sharpened by electrolysis. The electrodes were inserted in the large basiconic sensilla as previously described [3]. The recording equipment and software were supplied by Syntech.

**Odor stimulation**: Ethyl butyrate, the odor for activating Or22a neurons, was from Sigma-Aldrich which dissolved in paraffin oil, as previously described [3], by serial dilution, to make the concentration of 10-5, 10-6 (v/v). 3 µl of diluted odor was applied onto a piece of filter paper and inserted into a glass pasteur pipette, by the controlled air-pumping system, the odor was delivered onto the mounted fly’s antennae for 0.5 seconds.

**Immunohistochemistry**: Immunostaining on the whole-mount brains was performed as described previously [11]. The anti-NPF rabbit policlonal antibody from RayBiotech (product #RB-19-0001) was diluted to make 50 µg/ml before use. The neuropil-labeling nc82 antibody from DSHB was used at the concentration 7 µg/ml. Goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 488 (ab150085) and Goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor® 594 (A-11005), was used for the secondary antibodies. 

**Parasitoid wasps**: The common wasp parasite of Drosophila melanogaster larvae in nature, Leptopilina heterotoma was presented by Giovanni Bosco's lab 

**Behavioral analysis**: >10 assay sets for one genotype were prepared as described in (Fig 6-A). The assay sets were kept in a dark room for about 35 hours, after then, started counting the flies moved into the odor-chamber. Once the success rate of any group exceed 80%, the experiment was stopped and quantified and statistically analyzed.
