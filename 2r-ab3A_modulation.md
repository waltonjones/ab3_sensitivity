## _Drosophila_ show significant modulation of peripheral sensitivity to an important food-related odor

Fruit fly's sensilla, the sensory hairs covering the surface of the antennae and the maxillary palps, are classified by their morphology, and the neuronal types they are housing. An ab3, a type of the large antennal basiconic sensilla, was shown to be housing 2 different ORNs. And the two different ORNs generate large and small spikes respectively in the electrophysiological recording traces, according to which, the neuron generate the large spikes was named ab3A, the other one generate the small spikes, ab3B \cite{de_Bruyne_2001}.

The ab3A neurons express Or22a olfactory receptors (ORs) which are the receptors for the fruity odors like ethyl butyrate, a volatile ester found in apples and many other fruits \cite{Dobritsa_2003} \cite{2009}.
By using electrophysiological single-sensillum recordings (SSR), we examined fruit flies' olfactory sensitivity to apple odor and ethyl butyrate which is a major component of various fruit odors  (Fig. 1-A).
As expected, ab3A neurons robustly responded to the apple odor, in addition, they were sensitive enough to respond to the very low concentration of ethyl butyrate (Fig.
1-B).

Next we wondered if the sensitivity of ab3A neurons is always constant or conditionally changeable. Surprisingly, we found the sensitivity of ab3A neurons to ethyl butyrate increased over time after eclosion during the early maturation period until it reached to the maximum level in 7 days (Fig 1-C). This result suggests that the sensitivity of ab3A neurons is not inborn property. Instead, there must be a certain mechanism getting those neurons sensitized.
