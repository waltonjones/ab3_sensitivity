## _Drosophila_ show significant modulation of peripheral sensitivity to an important food-related odor

Fruit fly's sensilla, the sensory hairs covering the surface of the antennae and the maxillary palps, are classified by their morphology: basiconic, tricoid, coeloconic sensilla \cite{Shanbhag_1995}. Besides, according to their sizes, basiconic sensilla are named as large, thin, small basiconics. An ab3, one of the three types of the large antennal basiconic sensilla, was shown to be housing 2 different ORNs. And the two different ORNs generate large and small spikes respectively in the electrophysiological recording traces, according to which, the neuron generate the large spikes was named ab3A, the other one generate the small spikes, ab3B \cite{de_Bruyne_2001}. The ab3A neurons express Or22a olfactory receptors (ORs) which are the receptors for the fruity odors like ethyl butyrate, a volatile ester found in apples and many other fruits \cite{Dobritsa_2003} \cite{2009}. To generating action potentials, Or22a proteins are assembled with OR co-receptors (Orco) to form non-selective cation channels \cite{Benton_2006} \cite{Sato_2008}.

By using the electrophysiological recordings (SSR), we confirmed that fruit fly’s ab3A neurons are robustly activated by fresh apple odor and its major component, ethyl butyrate (Fig. 1-A, B). Next we wondered if the sensitivity of ab3A neurons are modulatory. To verify this question, we measured the sensitivity of ab3A neurons to ethyl butyrate after rearing the flies under various conditions (Data not shown). Interestingly, we found that ab3A neuron’s sensitivity is not steady throughout the adult life but is able to be modulated somehow. Quantified results for the electrophysiological recordings, ab3A neuron are actively sensitized during the early maturation period for about 3 days after eclosion (Fig. 1-C).
