## _Drosophila_ show significant modulation of peripheral sensitivity to a food-related odor

The olfactory sensilla of _Drosophile_ were first classified by morphology into basiconic, trichoid, and coeloconic shapes \cite{Shanbhag_1995}.
The largest are the club-shaped basiconic sensilla, which are further subdivided by location, size, and odorant receptor expression into 13 subclasses \cite{Couto_2005}.
Among the large antennal basiconics (ab), each sensillum of the ab3 class houses two OSNs designated ab3A and ab3B on the basis of spike amplitude, with ab3A giving the larger spikes \cite{de_Bruyne_2001}.
These ab3A neurons express the olfactory co-receptor Orco along with the odorant-specific odorant receptor Or22a \cite{Larsson_2004} \cite{Dobritsa_2003}.
OR22a is activated by several fruity-smelling esters including ethyl butyrate, a volatile abundant in apples and many other fruits \cite{2009}.

Using the single sensillum electrophysiological recording technique (SSR), we confirmed ab3A neurons are robustly activated by both fresh apple odor and by ethyl butyrate, one of its major components (Fig. 1A-B). 
Since an organism's sensitivity to food odor is highly dependent on its internal conditions, we wondered if the sensitivity of ab3A neurons are modulatory.
To verify this question, we measured the sensitivity of ab3A neurons to ethyl butyrate after rearing the flies under various conditions like calorie deprivation, nutrition-selective diet, high and low temperature, circadian rhythm, maturation status and etc. (Data not shown). 
Interestingly, we found that ab3A neuron's sensitivity is not steady throughout the adult life but is able to be modulated somehow. 
The age dependent change of sensitivity to ethyl butyrate show that ab3A neuron are actively sensitized during the early maturation period for about 3 days after eclosion (Fig. 1-C).
