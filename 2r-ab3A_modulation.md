## _Drosophila_ show modulation of peripheral sensitivity to a food-related odor

The olfactory sensilla of _Drosophila_ were first classified by morphology into basiconic, trichoid, and coeloconic shapes \cite{Shanbhag_1995}.
The largest are the club-shaped basiconic sensilla, which are further subdivided by location, size, and odorant receptor expression into 13 subclasses \cite{Couto_2005}.
Among the large antennal basiconics (ab), each sensillum of the ab3 class houses two OSNs designated ab3A and ab3B on the basis of spike amplitude, with ab3A giving the larger spikes \cite{de_Bruyne_2001}.
These ab3A neurons express the olfactory co-receptor Orco along with the odorant-specific odorant receptor OR22a \cite{Larsson_2004; Dobritsa_2003}.
OR22a is activated by several fruity-smelling esters including ethyl butyrate, a volatile abundant in apples and many other fruits \cite{2009}.

Using the single sensillum electrophysiological recording technique (SSR), we confirmed ab3A neurons are robustly activated by fresh apple odor and by ethyl butyrate, one of apple odor's major components (Fig. 1A-B). 
Since an animal's attraction to food odor depends on physiological states like sleep, hunger, and even age, we wondered if the peripheral sensitivity of the ab3A neurons may be modulated.
We, therefore, measured the sensitivity of ab3A neurons to ethyl butyrate (EB) after rearing flies under several conditions designed to modify their internal physiological states.
Under our conditions, we saw no significant changes in the dose-response relationship of the ab3A neurons to EB after caloric deprivation, rearing on protein-rich or carbohydrate-rich diets, rearing at high (29 °C) and low (18 °C) temperatures; neither did we see changes with circadian rhythm (data not shown). 
We did find, however, that the sensitivity of the ab3A neurons changes as female flies mature post-eclosion.
While the ab3A neurons of male *w^1118^* flies show a consistent response rate from 1--7 days post-eclosion, female ab3A neurons show a consistent age-dependent increase in EB sensitivity reaching male levels of sensitivity by 7 days post-eclosion (Fig. 1C).
