Figure 3. NPFR is expressed in Or22a neurons and is involved in sensitizing Or22a neurons

The quantification of the electrophysiological SSR of Or22a neurons for the sensitivity to ethyl butyrate 10-6, 10-5 (v/v) in NPFR-downregulated flies (A, B, C). The quantification of the age day-dependent sensitivity of Or22a neurons to EB 10-6 (v/v) in the early adult stage of the NPFR mutant and the control flies (D). (A-D. n≥6, Error bars: 95% CI, statistics: 2-way ANOVA, ***P ≤ 0.001)
