# Introduction

The olfaction-mediated feeding behaviors of insects are central to both positive and negative impacts that they have on human society. The integral role in the pollination of our crops depends on the insects actively seeking food. On the other, insects cannot act as vectors for the pathogens that cause diseases like malaria, yellow fever, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, or West Nile encephalitis without locating hosts by their olfaction to take an infectious bite. All of the roughly 100 million people per year who infected with malaria were the targets for blood-feeding of the infected mosquitoes. 

Insect olfaction detects thousands of different environmental chemicals at various sensitivity thresholds to improve food and mate seeking and in danger avoidance. Olfactory sensitivity thresholds can also be modulated depending on internal and external cues to adapt odor-guided behaviors to changing conditions. However, the mechanisms and the elements involved in the peripheral olfactory sensitization are still in veil. 

For this research, Drosophila, as an insect model, offers great tractability in genetic manipulation through the mass genetic tools that have been accumulated for over a hundred years. The major olfactory organs of Drosophila are the antennae and maxillary palps. These organs are covered by a dense population of hairs called sensilla. Each sensillum is filled with sensory lymph and is innervated by the dendrites of between one and four ORNs. When the molecules of an odor encounter Drosophila antennae, they diffuse into the sensilla through the pores and dissolve in the sensory lymph. Then the molecules are delivered to the olfactory receptors (ORs) and bind to them. Olfactory neuronal signal is transmitted from the Insect’s olfactory periphery to higher brain centers like mushroom body and lateral horn, centers for learning & memory and innate behaviors respectively, via antennal lobes. On the other way, the central brain sends signals to periphery according to the body’s internal needs in order to induce appropriate responses and behaviors.

Neuropeptides are small peptide molecules secreted by peptide-producing neurons. These are utilized for neuronal communication involved in food intake, metabolism, stress responses, reproduction, learning and memory, social behaviors, etc. Neuropeptide F (NPF) is known to be related with sensitizing sweet-sensitive Gr5a gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) by acting genetically upstream of dopaminergic neurons \cite{Inagaki_2014}. Many neuropeptides are secreted along with neurotransmitters like glutamate, dopamine, serotonin to modulate c neuronal  ,  () NPF is a known neuropeptide that is secreted by NPF producing cells in the brain, that stimulates feeding \cite{Wu_2003}\cite{Wu_2005}. Here, we demonstrate a role in Drosophila melanogaster for NPF in the sensitivity modulation of a specific population of antennal ORNs that detect fruity-smelling esters. Specifically, we show that knock-down of NPF in NPF neurons specifically reduces the sensitivity of Or22a neurons to ethyl butyrate, a volatile ester found in apples and other fruits. Knockdown of the NPFR in the Or22a neurons themselves also reduces their sensitivity as well as disrupting the ability of the flies to locate food. In humans, the NPF homologue NPY, plays a critical role in the generation of appetite. Thus, our results demonstrate a conserved peptidergic circuit that not only regulates appetite and food seeking behavior, but, in flies, also modulates the peripheral sensitivity to food odor and the ability of the animals to locate a food source.
