# Introduction

In addition to _Drosophila_'s utility as a model of human system, they are more closely related to and, therefore, even better models of other insect species. The olfaction-mediated feeding behaviors of insects are central to both positive and negative impacts that insects have on human society. The integral role that insects play in the pollination of our crops depends on the insects actively seeking food. Insects cannot act as vectors for the pathogens that cause diseases like malaria, yellow fever, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, or West Nile encephalitis without locating hosts by their olfaction to take an infectious bite. All of the roughly 100 million people per year that are infected with malaria are the target of the feeding behaviors of an infected mosquito. Thus, any insight we can gain on the mechanisms that control insect olfaction may be directly applied to enhancing the positive ways and diminishing the negative ways that insects interact with humanity.

_Drosophila_ also offers great tractability in genetic manipulation through the mass genetic tools that have been accumulated for over a hundred years. One of the most convenient tools among those for tissue specific analysis is the Gal4-UAS binary expression system. Gal4 is the transcription activator protein originated from yeast. It binds to the upstream activation sequence (UAS) and stimulates the transcription of the gene at the downstream of UAS. Since the Gal4 is not an endogenous protein for flies, without UAS, it does nothing in fly cells. For cell type-specific expression of Gal4, a desired promoter fragment can be fused with a Gal4 structural gene and introduced into the fly genome.

The major olfactory organs of _Drosophila_ are the antennae and maxillary palps. These organs are covered by a dense population of hairs called sensilla. Each sensillum is filled with sensory lymph and is innervated by the dendrites of between one and four olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). When molecules of volatile chemicals encounter Drosophila antennae, they diffuse into the sensillum through pores on its surface and dissolve in the sensory lymph (Fig. 1-A). These dissolved chemicals are delivered to the olfactory receptors (ORs) and bind to them. The ORs themselves were recently shown to be a large family of ligand-gated, non-selective cation channels \cite{Sato_2008} \cite{Wicher_2008}, and it is essential for their function to bind with olfactory co-receptors (Orco) which is broadly expressed throughout the antennae and maxillary palps \cite{Larsson_2004}. Thus, when an odorant ligand binds to its receptor, the channel opens and produces a local field potential (LFP) that triggers action potentials in the ORN \cite{Nagel_2011}. ORN axons are bundled into the antennal nerve, which travels back into the head and innervates a densely packed neuropil structure called the antennal lobe. The antennal lobe is composed of approximately 50 glomeruli, which are the sites of synapse between ORNs, olfactory projection neurons, and local inhibitory interneurons \cite{Bhalerao_2003}. The olfactory projection neurons deliver olfactory information to higher processing centers in the brain like the mushroom body and the lateral horn of the protocerebrum \cite{Stopfer_2003}.

Neuropeptides are small peptide molecules utilized by neurons for their communication.
