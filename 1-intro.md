# Introduction
Olfactory-guided behaviors, especially feeding behaviors, are central to both the positive and negative impact insects have on human society.
Honeybees and other insect pollinators depend heavily on their highly sensitive olfactory systems to find food.
Similarly, blood-feeding insects like the malaria mosquito _Anopheles gambiae_ would be much less effective in transmitting infectious pathogens if they lost their ability to detect the odor signatures of their human hosts.

The genetic model organism _Drosophila melanogaster_ has two paired olfactory organs---the antennae and maxillary palps---that are covered in porous hair-like projections called sensilla.
These sensilla, which are filled with sensory lymph, house the dendrites of one to four olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs).
Odor molecules diffuse through pores in the surface of the olfactory sensilla, dissolve in the sensory lymph, and bind odorant receptors (ORs) concentrated in the membranes of the OSN dendrites.
Since insect ORs are ligand-gated ion channels, this odor binding gates a non-selective cation current that triggers action potentials in the OSNs.
These odor-evoked spikes pass up the OSN axons bundled into the antennal nerve to the antennal lobe for processing before the olfactory information they encode is sent on to higher level processing centers like the mushroom body and lateral horn.

Insect olfactory systems detect thousands of environmental chemicals at varying concentration thresholds for directing appropriate behavioral responses.
These olfactory sensitivity thresholds, however, often require modulation depending on both internal and external cues to flexibly adapt odor-guided behaviors to changing environmental conditions.
When an animal reaches sexual maturity, for example, an increase in its sensitivity to sex pheromones or other conspecific odors should improve its chances of productive mating.
In hungry flies, increased expression of the neuropeptide receptor sNPFR leads to a pre-synaptic facilitation of food-related olfactory circuits that drives increased food search behaviors \cite{Root_2011}.
Here, we investigate another mechanism underlying the sensitivity modulation of a specific population of OSNs in _Drosophila_ that detect food-related odors.

Specifically, we identify a role for neuropeptide F (NPF) in the sensitivity modulation of a specific population of OSNs in _Drosophila_ that detect fruity-smelling esters.
We show NPF neuron-specific knock-down of NPF reduces the sensitivity of ab3A neurons, which express OR22a, to ethyl butyrate, a volatile ester found in apples and other fruits.
We also show OR22a neuron-specific knock-down of NPFR produces a similar reduction in sensitivity and disrupts the ability of the flies to locate food.
Thus, our results demonstrate that, in addition to regulating appetite and food-seeking behavior, the NPF-NPFR signaling axis  also regulates peripheral sensitivity to food odors.
