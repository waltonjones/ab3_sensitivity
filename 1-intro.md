# Introduction
Olfactory-guided behaviors, especially feeding behaviors, are central to both the positive and negative impact insects have on human society.
Honeybees and other insect pollinators depend heavily on their highly sensitive olfactory systems to find food.
Similarly, blood-feeding insects like the malaria mosquito _Anopheles gambiae_ would be much less effective in transmitting infectious pathogens if they lost their ability to detect the odor signatures of their human hosts.

Insect olfactory systems detect thousands of environmental chemicals at varying concentration thresholds adapted by evolution for directing appropriate behavioral responses.
These olfactory sensitivity thresholds, however, often require modulation depending on both internal and external cues to flexibly adapt odor-guided behaviors to changing environmental conditions.
Here, we use the genetic model organism _Drosophila melanogaster_ to investigate the mechanisms underlying sensory adaptation in a specific population of olfactory neurons that detect food-related odors.

_Drosophila_ have two types of paired olfactory organs---the antennae and maxillary palps---that are covered in porous hair-like projections called sensilla.
These sensilla, which are filled with sensory lymph, house the dendrites of one to four olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs).
When the molecules of an odor encounter Drosophila antennae, they diffuse into the sensilla through the pores and dissolve in the sensory lymph.
Then the molecules are delivered to the olfactory receptors (ORs) and bind to them.
Olfactory neuronal signal is transmitted from the Insect's olfactory periphery to higher brain centers like mushroom body and lateral horn, centers for learning & memory and innate behaviors respectively, via antennal lobes.
On the other way, the central brain sends signals to periphery according to the body's internal needs in order to induce appropriate responses and behaviors.

Neuropeptides are small peptide molecules secreted by peptide-producing neurons.
These are utilized for neuronal communication involved in food intake, metabolism, stress responses, reproduction, learning and memory, social behaviors, etc.
Some neuropeptides promote specific behavior by sensitizing the relevant peripheral neurons.
NPF is a known neuropeptie related with sensitizing sweet-sensitive Gr5a gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) by acting genetically upstream of dopaminergic neurons \cite{Inagaki_2014}.
Here, we demonstrate another role in Drosophila melanogaster for NPF in the sensitivity modulation of a specific population of antennal ORNs that detect fruity-smelling esters.
Specifically, we show that knock-down of NPF in NPF neurons specifically reduces the sensitivity of Or22a neurons to ethyl butyrate, a volatile ester found in apples and other fruits.
Knockdown of the NPFR in the Or22a neurons themselves also reduces their sensitivity as well as disrupting the ability of the flies to locate food.
In humans, the NPF homologue NPY, plays a critical role in the generation of appetite.
Thus, our results demonstrate a conserved peptidergic circuit that not only regulates appetite and food seeking behavior, but, in flies, also modulates the peripheral sensitivity to food odor and the ability of the animals to locate a food source.
