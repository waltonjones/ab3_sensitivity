# Introduction

The olfaction-mediated feeding behaviors of insects are central to both positive and negative impacts that insects have on human society. The integral role in the pollination of our crops depends on the insects actively seeking food. On the other, insects cannot act as vectors for the pathogens that cause diseases like malaria, yellow fever, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, or West Nile encephalitis without locating hosts by their olfaction to take an infectious bite. All of the roughly 100 million people per year who infected with malaria were the targets for blood-feeding of the infected mosquitoes. 

Drosophila, as an insect model, offers great tractability in genetic manipulation through the mass genetic tools that have been accumulated for over a hundred years. The major olfactory organs of Drosophila are the antennae and maxillary palps. These organs are covered by a dense population of hairs called sensilla. Each sensillum is filled with sensory lymph and is innervated by the dendrites of between one and four ORNs. When the molecules of an odor encounter Drosophila antennae, they diffuse into the sensilla through the pores and dissolve in the sensory lymph. Then the molecules are delivered to the olfactory receptors (ORs) and bind to them. Olfactory neuronal signal is transmitted from the Insect’s olfactory periphery to higher brain centers like mushroom body and lateral horn, centers for learning & memory and innate behaviors respectively, via antennal lobes.

On the other way, the central brain sends signals to periphery according to the body’s internal needs in order to induce appropriate responses and behaviors. NPF is a known neuropeptide that is secreted by NPF producing cells in the brain, that stimulates feeding \cite{Wu_2003}\cite{Wu_2005}. 

_Drosophila_ also offers great tractability in genetic manipulation through the mass genetic tools that have been accumulated for over a hundred years. The major olfactory organs of _Drosophila_ are the antennae and maxillary palps. These organs are covered by a dense population of hairs called sensilla. Each sensillum is filled with sensory lymph and is innervated by the dendrites of between one and four olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). When molecules of volatile chemicals encounter Drosophila antennae, they diffuse into the sensillum through pores on its surface and dissolve in the sensory lymph. These dissolved odors are delivered to the olfactory receptors (ORs) and bind to them. The ORs themselves were recently shown to be a large family of ligand-gated, non-selective cation channels \cite{Sato_2008} \cite{Wicher_2008}, and it is essential for their function to bind with olfactory co-receptors (Orco) which is broadly expressed throughout the antennae and maxillary palps \cite{Larsson_2004}. Thus, when an odorant ligand binds to its receptor, the channel opens and produces a local field potential (LFP) that triggers action potentials in the ORN \cite{Nagel_2011}. ORN axons are bundled into the antennal nerve, which travels back into the head and innervates a densely packed neuropil structure called the antennal lobe. The antennal lobe is composed of approximately 50 glomeruli, which are the sites of synapse between ORNs, olfactory projection neurons, and local inhibitory interneurons \cite{Bhalerao_2003}. The olfactory projection neurons deliver olfactory information to higher processing centers in the brain like the mushroom body and the lateral horn of the protocerebrum \cite{Stopfer_2003}.

Neuropeptides are small peptide molecules utilized by neurons for communicating each other.


In addition to _Drosophila_'s utility as a model of human system, they are more closely related to and, therefore, even better models of other insect species.
