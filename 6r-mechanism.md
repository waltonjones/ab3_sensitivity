## Exploring the mechanism of NPFR-mediated olfactory modulation

OSN dendrites are divided into inner and outer segments by a small swelling known as the ciliary dilation (Fig. 6A, left).
OSN responses to odor require the expression and trafficking of ORs to the outer dendritic segment where they can encounter odorant molecules \cite{Elmore_2003, Larsson_2004}.
We hypothesized NPF-NPFR signaling may modulate the sensitivity of ab3A neurons to ethyl butyrate by altering either the expression or trafficking of the OR expressed in ab3A neurons that responds to ethyl butyrate, OR22a \cite{Dobritsa_2003}.
We, therefore, used an OR22a-specific antibody to compare the levels of OR22a in the outer dendrites of ab3A neurons from _w^1118^_ and _NPFR^c01896^_ antennae.
In _w^1118^_ antennae, the ab3A neurons show almost no OR22a staining in the soma, very little in the ciliary dilations, and strong signal in the outer dendritic segments (Fig. 6A, center).
_NPFR^c01896^_ mutant ab3A neurons show slightly stronger OR22a staining in their soma, strong punctate staining in their inner dendritic segments and ciliary dilations, and strong staining in their outer dendritic segments (Fig. 6A, right).
This staining pattern in _NPFR^c01896^_ ab3A neurons is reminiscent of that produced in the absence of the olfactory co-receptor Orco, except for the OR22a in the outer dendrites, which is not present in _Orco^1^_ mutants \cite{Benton_2006}.
Although this increase in intracellular OR22a in the absence of NPFR suggests a role for NPFR in modulating the dendritic trafficking of OR22a, we were unable to detect a difference when we quantified the OR22a-stained pixels in the outer dendrites of _w^1118^_ and _NPFR^c01896^_ antennae using ImageJ (Fig. 6B).
Neither were we able to detect a difference in Or22a mRNA levels between _w^1118^_ and _NPFR^c01896^_ antennae via qPCR (Fig. 6C).
