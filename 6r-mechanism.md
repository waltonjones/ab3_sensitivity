## Exploring the mechanism of NPFR-mediated olfactory modulation

OSN dendrites are separated into inner and outer segments by a small swelling known as the ciliary dilation (Fig. 6A, left).
OSN responses to odor require the expression and trafficking of ORs to the outer dendritic segment where they can encounter odorant molecules \cite{Elmore_2003, Larsson_2004}.
We, therefore, hypothesized NPF-NPFR signaling may modulate the sensitivity of ab3A neurons to ethyl butyrate by altering either the expression or trafficking of the OR expressed in ab3A neurons that responds to ethyl butyrate, OR22a \cite{Dobritsa_2003}.

We wondered if NPF-NPFR signaling sensitize the ab3A neurons by enhancing the level of expression or dendritic trafficking of OR22a. 
However, the quantification result by using qPCR, shows that there is no difference in the level of Or22a mRNA between the NPFR mutants and its genetic control flies (Fig 3A).
Furthermore, the Or22a immunostaining results for the _Drosophila_ antennae show that Or22a trafficking to the dendrites is not decreased in the NPFR mutant flies (Fig 3B, C).
