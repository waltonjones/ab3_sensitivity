# Abstract

## Background
Animal olfactory systems detect volatile environmental chemicals and integrate this information to direct the finding of food and mates as well as the avoidance of danger.
Rather than remaining constant, olfactory sensitivity thresholds can be modulated by internal and external cues to adapt odor-guided behaviors to changing conditions.

## Results
Here, we demonstrate in *Drosophila melanogaster* that neuropeptide F (NPF) modulates the sensitivity of a specific population of antennal olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to food-derived odors.
We show knock-down of NPF in NPF neurons specifically reduces the sensitivity of the ab3A neurons to ethyl butyrate, a volatile ester found in apples and other fruits.
ab3A neuron-specific knock-down of the NPF receptor (NPFR) reduces their sensitivity and disrupts the ability of the flies to locate food.
We also identify a sexually dimorphism in ab3A sensitivity: ab3A neurons in females immediately post-eclosion are less sensitive to ethyl butyrate than those of both age-matched males and older females.
Not only does this change in sensitivity correlate with brain NPF levels, NPFR mutants show no such sexual dimorphism.
Finally, by way of mechanism, we show that mutation of NPFR seems to affect the localization of OR22a, the odorant receptor expressed in the ab3A neurons.

## Conclusions
Interestingly, this modulation of the peripheral odorant sensitivity of the ab3A neurons by NPF is distinct from the modulation of pre-synaptic gain in the ab3A neurons previously observed with the similarly named but distinct neuropeptide sNPF.
Rather than affecting the strength of the output at the level of the first synapse in the antennal lobe, NPF-NPFR signaling seems to affect the process of odorant detection itself by affecting OR localization.
