**NPF signaling underlies the sensitization mechanism for Or22a neurons**

Out of the results of gene knock-down screenings and preliminary experiments, we found knock-down of NPF, by using NPF RNAi and 386Y-Gal4 pan-peptidergic neuron driver, reduces the sensitivity of Or22a neurons (Fig 2-B). Again, as expected, knock-down of NPF by using NPF producing neuron-specific NPF-Gal4 driver, also desensitized Or22a neurons as well (Fig 2-C). Furthermore, prolonged exposure of the female parasitoid wasps, Leptopilina heterotoma, to the female wild-type flies significantly reduced the sensitivity of Or22a neurons (Fig 2-D), which is a consistent result with the previous report that exposing female parasitoid wasps to female fruit flies reduces NPF level in the fly brain \cite{Kacsoh_2013}. These results clearly demonstrate that down-regulation of NPF in the brain make the Or22a neurons desensitized.
