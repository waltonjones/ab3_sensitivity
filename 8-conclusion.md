# Conclusion
<<<<<<< HEAD
The majority of the impact insects have on human society stems from their feeding behaviors (e.g., destroying our crops or transmitting disease through infectious bites).
Since many insect feeding behaviors are guided by their olfactory systems, we were interested in how the olfactory system may change in response to internal and external cues.
Here, we demonstrate in the genetic model insect _Drosophila melanogaster_ that NPF acts on its receptor NPFR to sensitize a specific population of antennal olfactory neurons that detect an important food-related odorant.
We show that this peripheral olfactory modulation by NPF and NPFR is sexually dimorphic in young adult flies and that it affects olfactory-guided attraction to food odors. 
Since homologues of NPF and NPFR exist across insect species, it will be interesting to see whether their modulation of olfactory food detection is also conserved.
If so, it may represent another potential targert for future pest control strategies.

Insects affect human society with a strong influences by their feeding activities which are enabled by their olfactory abilities. Although an insect’s olfactory neurons are basically quite sensitive, they can be even more sensitized by signaling molecules from the brain depending on the internal or environmental conditions. In this research, we have demonstrated that an insect model _Drosophila_ brain utilize NPF signaling to sensitize a specific population of food-odor sensitive olfactory periphery, ab3A neurons, which express NPF receptor. Furthermore, this NPF-NPFR driven olfactory sensitization offers this insect a greater detectability for food, in turn, about more than 50% higher foraging abilities according to our experiments. Considering that both harmful and useful insects are highly depending on their olfaction to search food including human hosts, our study reveals the major mechanism of insect’s olfactory sensitization for food, which can be utilized in future for developing methods to control insects.
