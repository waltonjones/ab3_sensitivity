# Conclusion
Insects affect human society with a strong influences by their feeding activities which are enabled by their olfactory abilities. Although an insect’s olfactory neurons are basically quite sensitive, they can be even more sensitized by signaling molecules from the brain, depending on the internal or environmental conditions. In this research, we have demonstrated that an insect model _Drosophila_ brain utilize NPF signaling to sensitize a specific population of food-odor sensitive olfactory periphery, ab3A neurons, which express NPF receptor. Furthermore, this NPF-NPFR driven olfactory sensitization offers this insect a greater detectability for food, in turn, about more than 50% higher foraging abilities according to our experiments. Considering that both harmful and useful insects are highly depending on their olfaction to search food including human hosts, our study reveals the major mechanism of insect’s olfactory sensitization for food, which can be utilized in future for developing methods to control insects.
