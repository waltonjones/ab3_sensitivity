# Conclusion
The majority of the impact insects have on human society stems from their feeding behaviors (e.g., destroying our crops or transmitting disease through infectious bites).
Since many insect feeding behaviors are guided by their olfactory systems, we were interested in how the olfactory system may change in response to internal and external cues.
Here, we demonstrate in the genetic model insect _Drosophila melanogaster_ that NPF acts on its receptor NPFR to sensitize a specific population of antennal olfactory neurons that detect an important food-related odorant.
We show that this peripheral olfactory modulation by NPF and NPFR is sexually dimorphic in young adult flies and that it affects olfactory-guided attraction to food odors. 
Since homologues of NPF and NPFR exist across insect species, it will be interesting to see whether these homologues also modulate of olfactory food detection in these species. If so, this modulation may represent another potential target for future pest control strategies.
