##The ab3A neurons express NPFR and receive NPF signal directly mediating the sensitizaiton of ab3A neurons

Next we tried to seek for the NPFR-expressing target cells of NPF. Since the first candidate target of NPF that we thought of was some subpopulation of ORNs, by using UAS-NPFR RNAi flies, we knocked-down NPFR in the whole ORNs. Surprisingly, NPFR-downregulated flies in the whole ORNs showed significantly reduced sensitivity of ab3A neurons (Fig 5-A). Furthermore, knock-down of NPFR in the ab3A neurons specifically, by Or22a-Gal4, significantly desensitized the neurons as well (Fig 5-B). 

(the result for an NPFR rescue experiment)

This result suggest that ab3A neurons themselves are expressing NPFR and receive NPF signal directly, mediating the sensitizing mechanism for the ab3A neurons.
