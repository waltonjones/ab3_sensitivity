##Ab3A neurons express NPFR and receive NPF signal directly

Next we wondered what is the receptor for NPF for sensitizing Or22a neurons, and where would it be expressed.
Neuropeptide F receptor (NPFR) is a known receptor for NPF \cite{Garczynski_2002}.
We first tested the flies with a piggyBac transposon-inserted mutation in NPFR locus, which had been previously utilized for the hypomorphic NPFR mutant \cite{Krashes_2009}.
As expected, the Or22a neurons of the NPFR mutants combined with the NPFR gene-deficient chromosome showed significantly reduced sensitivity to ethyl butyrate (Fig 3-A).
It suggest that the NPFR is the receptor for NPF involved in the sensitization mechanism for Or22a neurons.
Next, we wondered if ORNs express NPFR.
If so, NPF may directly react onto the NPFR on the ORNs to activate the downstream mechanisms for sensitizing the neurons.
First we down-regulated the expression of NPFR using NPFR RNAi and ORN-specific Orco-Gal4 driver.
Surprisingly, down-regulating NPFR in ORNs significantly desensitized Or22a neurons (Fig 3-B).
Furthermore, Or22a neuron-specific down-regulation of NPFR desensitized Or22a neurons as well (Fig 3-C).
These results suggest that Or22a neurons are expressing NPFR and directly reacting the NPF signal.

Finally, we asked if loss of NPFR results in failure of maturation-dependent sensitization of Or22a neurons.
Compared to the w1118 control flies, which clearly showed maturation-dependent sensitization of Or22a neurons within three days, NPFRPBac mutant flies could not sensitize Or22a neurons at all (Fig 3-D).
This result suggests that NPF-NPFR signaling dependent sensitization mechanism is not only for the post-maturation period, but also for the early maturation process after eclosion.
