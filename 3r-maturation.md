## NPF-NPFR signaling sensitizes ab3A neurons as flies mature

Since the ab3A neurons of male and female flies (_w^1118^_) show differential sensitivity to ethyl butyrate 1 day after eclosion (Fig. 1C), we wondered whether we can attribute this sexual dimorphism to NPF signaling.
After dissecting brains from _w^1118^_ males and females 1 day after eclosion, we stained them with an anti-NPF antibody (Fig. 3A).
After processing confocal images of 6 brains from each sex with ImageJ \cite{Schneider_2012}, we found significantly higher NPF staining per pixel in male brains than female brains (Fig. 3B).


Together, these results suggest sexual dimorphisms in NPF expression or release account for the differential sensitivity of male and female ab3A neurons as they mature.
