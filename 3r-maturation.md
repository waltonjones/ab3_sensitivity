## NPF-NPFR signaling sensitizes ab3A neurons as flies mature

Since the ab3A neurons of male and female flies (_w^1118^_) show differential sensitivity to ethyl butyrate 1 day after eclosion (Fig. 1C), we wondered whether we can attribute this sexual dimorphism to NPF signaling.
After dissecting brains from _w^1118^_ males and females 1 day after eclosion, we stained them with an anti-NPF antibody (Fig. 3A).
After processing confocal images of 6 brains from each sex with ImageJ \cite{Schneider_2012}, we found significantly higher NPF staining per pixel in male brains than female brains (Fig. 3B).
We next compared the electrophysiological responses of ab3A neurons from _w^1118^_ flies with those of _NPFR^c01896^_ flies over the first week of adult life.
We found that the ab3A neurons of both male (♂) and female (♀) _NPFR^c01896^_ flies show steadily low sensitivity to ethyl butyrate (EB, 10^-5^ v/v) through the first week post-eclosion (Fig. 3C).
By comparison, the sensitivity of _w^1118^_ males is significantly higher from days 1--7.
The sensitivity of female _w^1118^_ ab3A neurons, in contrast,is as low as that of _NPFR^c01896^_ ab3A neurons on day 1, but rises to the male _w^1118^_ level by day 7 (Fig. 3C).
Note that the _w^1118^_ data represented in Figure 3C are identical to those in Figure 1C and are shown again for comparison's sake.
Together, these results suggest sexual dimorphisms in NPF signaling account for the differential sensitivity of female ab3A neurons as they mature.
