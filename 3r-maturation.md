## NPF-NPFR signaling sensitizes ab3A neurons as flies mature

Since the ab3A neurons of male and female flies (_w^1118^_) show different levels of sensitivity to ethyl butyrate 1 day after eclosion (Fig. 1C), we wondered whether this sexual dimorphism can be attributed to NPF signaling.
NPF immunostaining results showed that significantly different level of NPF in the brains between males and females after about 24 hours of eclosion (Fig. 3A, B).
In addition, NPFR mutant flies showed failure in sensitizing ab3A neurons in the early maturation period after eclosion (Fig. 3C).
This result demonstrate that the sensitization process for ab3A neurons during the early maturation period is mediated by NPF-NPFR signaling.
