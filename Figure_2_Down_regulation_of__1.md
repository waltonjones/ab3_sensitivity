Figure 2. Down-regulation of NPF desensitize fruit odor-sensitive Or22a neurons.

The quantification of the electrophysiological SSR of Or22a neurons for the sensitivity to ethyl butyrate 10-6, 10-5 (v/v) in NPFR-downregulated flies (A, B). Immunostaining for NPF after NPF knocked-down shows absence of NPF in the brain (C). The quantification of the electrophysiological SSR of Or22a neurons for the sensitivity to ethyl butyrate 10-6, 10-5 (v/v) in NPFR-mutant flies (D). The quantification of the age day-dependent sensitivity of Or22a neurons to EB 10-6 (v/v) in the early adult stage of the NPFR mutant and the control flies (E). (A, B, D, E. n≥6, Error bars: 95% CI, statistics: 2-way ANOVA, ***P ≤ 0.001)
