Here, we identified a role in _Drosophila_ for Neuropeptide F (NPF) and its receptor NPFR in modulating the peripheral sensitivity of the ab3A class of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs).
These neurons detect a range of fruity-smelling esters associated with the fruits that provide _Drosophila_ food and a place to lay their eggs.
We showed loss of NPF in NPF neurons reduces odor-evoked spiking of ab3A neurons in response to ethyl butyrate without affecting their spontaneous activity.
It does not, however, affect the responses of ab1A or ab2A neurons to their preferred ligands.
We also showed the ab3A neurons themselves must express NPFR to exhibit this change in olfactory sensitivity, as ab3A-specific expression of NPFR rescues the reduced olfactory sensitivity induced by the hypomorphic NPFR mutation _NPFR^c01896^_. 

Root et al. found the neuropeptide sNPF modulates the responses of DM1, DM2, and DM4---the antennal lobe glomeruli that receive input from the ab1A, ab3A, and ab2A neurons, respectively \cite{Root_2011}.
They found that the ab1A, ab2A, and ab3A neurons themselves produce sNPF, and that once released, it alters the calcium responses of their own presynaptic terminals.
This acts as a sort of gain control, enhancing the activation of the corresponding second-order olfactory projection neurons.
In the ab1A neurons, they were able to unambiguously attribute this presynaptic gain control to the sNPF receptor sNPFR1 and show that the expression of sNPFR1 is altered by insulin signaling and starvation.
This means the ab1A neurons, which respond to food-related esters like the ab3A neurons, induce larger responses in their associated projection neurons in times of starvation, enhancing foraging behavior.

The NPF-mediated modulation of ab3A neurons we discovered differs from this sNPF-mediated gain control in at least two ways.
First, the ab3A neurons themselves produce only the neuropeptide receptor, not the neuropeptide.
Second, rather than magnifying presynaptic calcium responses, NPFR activation increases the number of odor-evoked action potentials in the ab3A neurons.



When a fly is hungry, the NPF secretion in the fly brain is stimulated, in turn, sugar-sensitive Gr5a neurons are sensitized via dopamine signaling \cite{Inagaki_2014}. Considering our study that when NPF-NPFR signaling is activated, it also sensitize the olfactory sensitivity for the major fruit odor-ethyl butyrate, NPF seems to be a neuropeptide molecule that is masterminding sugar-related peripheral sensitivity. 

It is unclear what these OR22a-positive puncta are, but they Benton et al. showed significant overlap of the mis-localized OR22a protein in _Orco^1^_ mutant antennae with a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum ... are these internalized or simply not externalized yet?
