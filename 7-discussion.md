# Discussion

Here, we identified a role in _Drosophila_ for Neuropeptide F (NPF) and its receptor NPFR in modulating the peripheral sensitivity of the ab3A class of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs).
These neurons detect a range of fruity-smelling esters associated with the fruits that provide _Drosophila_ food and a place to lay their eggs.
We showed loss of NPF in NPF neurons reduces odor-evoked spiking of ab3A neurons in response to ethyl butyrate without affecting their spontaneous activity.
It does not, however, affect the responses of ab1A or ab2A neurons to their preferred ligands.
We also showed the ab3A neurons themselves must express NPFR to exhibit this increase in olfactory sensitivity, as ab3A-specific expression of NPFR rescues the loss of sensitivity induced by the hypomorphic NPFR mutation _NPFR^c01896^_. 

Previously, Root et al. found the neuropeptide sNPF modulates the responses of DM1, DM2, and DM4---the antennal lobe glomeruli that receive input from the ab1A, ab3A, and ab2A neurons, respectively \cite{Root_2011}.
They found the ab1A and ab3A neurons themselves produce sNPF, which when released, alters the calcium responses of their own presynaptic terminals.
This acts as a sort of gain control, enhancing the activation of the corresponding second-order olfactory projection neurons.
In the ab1A neurons, Root et al. were able to unambiguously attribute this presynaptic gain control to the sNPF receptor sNPFR1 and show that the expression of sNPFR1 is altered by insulin signaling and starvation.
This means the ab1A neurons, which respond to food-related esters like the ab3A neurons, induce larger responses in their associated projection neurons in times of starvation, enhancing foraging behavior.

The NPF-mediated modulation of ab3A neurons we discovered differs from this sNPF-mediated gain control in at least two respects.
First, the ab3A neurons themselves produce only the neuropeptide receptor, not the neuropeptide.
Second, rather than magnifying presynaptic calcium responses as sNPFR activation seems to do, NPFR activation increases the number of odor-evoked action potentials in the ab3A neurons.
At this point, it is unclear how these two pathways are related and what other implications these distinctions may have, but they certainly suggest the modulation of ab3A by NPF and sNPF employ different molecular mechanisms.

To address this mechanism, we stained NPFR mutant antennae with an antibody that recognizes OR22a, the odorant receptor expressed by the ab3A neurons.
Surprisingly, we were unable to detect a difference in OR22a staining in the outer ab3A dendrites where odorant binding takes place.
Still, compared to control antennae, NPFR mutant antennae show dramatically more OR22a-positive puncta near the ciliary dilations that separate the inner and outer ab3A dendritic segments.
It is unclear what these OR22a-positive puncta are, but we expect they either represent OR molecules whose trafficking to the ciliated outer dendrites is being blocked or whose internalization from the periphery is being enhanced.
These puncta strongly resemble the OR22a-positive puncta that appear in the absence of the olfactory co-receptor Orco required for OR trafficking to the ciliated outer dendrites and co-localize with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum \cite{Benton_2006}.
This supports the former hypothesis---a specific reduction in the trafficking of OR22a in the absence of NPFR.
Bahk and Jones recently showed calmodulin interacts with Orco to regulate OR trafficking to the ciliated outer dendrites in an OSN activity-dependent manner \cite{Bahk_2016}.
As a G protein-coupled receptor, NPFR may induce an increase in intracellular calcium that acts through calmodulin to alter OR22a trafficking, but the signaling pathways downstream of NPFR have not yet been characterized.

In this study, we also found female flies show lower ab3A sensitivity immediately post-eclosion than male flies, but this difference disappears as the flies age.
We found a clear correlation between ab3A sensitivity and NPF staining in young female versus male brains and showed that this sexual dimorphism is absent in _NPFR^c01896^_ mutants.
The function of this sexual dimorphism is unclear, but it may enhance dispersal of young females to new and more palatable food sources.
Once _Drosophila_ larvae reach their final larval instar, they stop foraging and move out of their food to find a dry location to pupate.
A piece of fruit that was suitable for laying eggs at the beginning of one round of the 10--14 day _Drosophila_ life cycle may be less suitable for a second.
Thus, the reduction in olfactory sensitivity to fruit odors we observe in young female flies may help encourage them to find new food sources for egg laying.
It will be interesting to test this hypothesis in future studies.
