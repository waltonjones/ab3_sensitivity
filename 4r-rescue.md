## NPFR is required in ab3A neurons to determine their sensitivity

We next asked where NPFR is required to determine olfactory sensitivity.
Since the most obvious candidate is the OSNs themselves, we first used _Orco-GAL4_ to knock-down NPFR in all the OSNs that express the olfactory co-receptor Orco.
We found ab3A neurons from _Orco>NPFR-IR_ flies show significantly lower sensitivity to ethyl butyrate (EB, 10^-6^ and 10^-5^ v/v) than their heterozygous controls (crossed to _w^1118^_) (Fig. 4A).
While _Orco-GAL4_ labels most OSNs in the antennae and all OSNs in the maxillary palps, _Or22a-GAL4_ labels only ab3A neurons.
As with _Orco>NPFR-IR_ flies, though, the ab3A neurons of _Or22a>NPFR-IR_ flies also show lower ab3A sensitivity to EB than their heterozygous controls (Fig. 4B).
We next generated 
Specific NPFR rescue in the ab3A neurons, NPFR-RD type transcript in this case, dramatically restored the sensitivity of ab3A neurons in the NPFR mutant flies (Fig 5C, D).
On the other hand, expressing NPFR-RB type transcript could not restore the sensitivity of ab3A neurons in the mutant flies (Fig 5D). 
This result demonstrate that NPFR-RD type transcript is expressed in the ab3A neurons to receive NPF signal directly.
Since Or22a gene begins to be expressed after the olfactory neuronal morphogeneis, Or22a-Gal4 driven NPFR rescue result also suggest that NPF-NPFR mediated sensitization of the ab3A neurons is not via developmental morphogenesis of the neurons.
