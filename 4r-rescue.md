## NPFR is required in ab3A neurons to determine their sensitivity

We next asked where NPFR is required for determining ab3A sensitivity.
Since the most obvious candidate is the OSNs themselves, we first used _Orco-GAL4_ to knock-down NPFR in all the OSNs that express the olfactory co-receptor Orco.
We found ab3A neurons from _Orco>NPFR-IR_ flies show significantly lower sensitivity to ethyl butyrate (EB, 10^-6^ and 10^-5^ v/v) than their heterozygous controls (crossed to _w^1118^_) (Fig. 4A).
While _Orco-GAL4_ labels most OSNs in the antennae and all OSNs in the maxillary palps, _Or22a-GAL4_ labels only ab3A neurons.
As with _Orco>NPFR-IR_ flies, the ab3A neurons of _Or22a>NPFR-IR_ flies show lower ab3A sensitivity to EB than their heterozygous controls (Fig. 4B).

We next isolated total RNA from _w^1118^_ heads for cDNA synthesis.
From the resulting head cDNAs, we were able to clone versions of two of the NPFR transcripts annotated in Flybase, _NPFR-RB_ and _NPFR-RD_.
We used both of these to generate transgenic UAS-NPFR lines and then used them to perform a ab3A neuron-specific rescue of the _NPFR^c01896^_ mutation.
Looking at sample traces from this experiment, it is clear _NPFR-RD_ fully rescues the sensitivity of ab3A neurons to EB (10^-6^ v/v) (Fig. 4C).
In figure 4D, we present a quantification of recordings comparing the _w^1118_ genetic background control to the _NPFR^c01896^_ mutant as well as the ab3A neuron-specific rescue (_Or22a-GAL4>UAS-NPFR-RD, NPFR^c01896^_) compared to its appropriate heterozygous controls (Fig. 4D).
Interestingly, although the _NPFR-RB_ isoform appeared far more often among the _w^1118^_ cDNAs we used to generate the UAS-NPFR lines than the _NPFR-RD_ isoform, it fails to rescue the ab3A sensitivity phenotype (Fig. 4D).
