Animal olfactory systems detect volatile environmental chemicals and integrate this information to direct the finding of food and mates as well as the avoidance of danger.
Rather than remaining constant, olfactory sensitivity thresholds are modulated by internal and external cues to adapt odor-guided behaviors to changing conditions.
Here, we demonstrate in *Drosophila melanogaster* that neuropeptide F (NPF) modulates the sensitivity of a specific population of antennal olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to food-derived odors.
We show knock-down of NPF in NPF neurons specifically reduces the sensitivity of Or22a neurons to ethyl butyrate, a volatile ester found in apples and other fruits.
Or22a neuron-specific knock-down of the NPF receptor (NPFR) also reduces their sensitivity and disrupts the ability of the flies to locate food.
Both NPF and its human analog NPY are important signals in the generation of appetite.
Thus, our results suggest a similar peptidergic circuit that not only regulates appetite and food seeking behavior, but, in flies, also modulates peripheral sensitivity to food odor and the ability to locate a food source.
