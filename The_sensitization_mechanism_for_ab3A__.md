## The sensitization mechanism for ab3A neurons by NPF-NPFR signaling is not via enhancing Or22a expression or trafficking to the dendrites

The expression level of OR or its trafficking to the dendrites significantly affect the ORN's sensitivity  (Elmore 2003) \cite{Larsson_2004}.
The ab3A neurons express OR22a and OR22b ORs \cite{Dobritsa_2003}. 
The fruity odor ethyl butyrate has great affinity to OR22a, but not to OR22b \cite{Dobritsa_2003}. 
We wondered if NPF-NPFR signaling increase the sensitivity of ab3A neurons by enhancing the level of expression or dendritic trafficking of OR22a. 
However, the quantification result, by using qPCR, shows that there is no difference in mRNA level of OR22a between NPFR mutants and its genetic control flies (Fig 3-A). 
Furthermore, the Or22a immunostaining results for the fly antennae show that there is no decrease in the dendritic trafficking level of OR22a in the NPFR mutant flies (Fig 3-B, C).
