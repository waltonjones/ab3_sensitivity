## NPF-NPFR signaling sensitizes ab3A neurons

We expected this modulation of the ab3A neurons may be  peptidergic.
Indeed, the combination of a GAL4 enhancer trap expressed in many adult peptidergic neurons (_386Y-GAL4_) with an RNAi line specific to Neuropeptide F (NPF) (_UAS-NPF-IR_) significantly reduces the sensitivity of ab3A neurons to EB (Fig 2A).
In _Drosophila_, NPF has been implicated in several physiological phenomena including appetite regulation \cite{Wu_2003} and the modulation of gustatory responses to sugar \cite{Inagaki_2014}.
We also found limiting the knock-down of NPF to NPFergic neurons using _NPF-GAL4_, produces an even larger reduction in ab3A sensitivity to EB (Fig 2B).
_NPF>NPF-IR_ brains show almost no NPF signal compared to the appropriate heterozygous controls (i.e., crossed to _w^1118^_) (Fig. S1).
The reduction in peripheral olfactory sensitivity is specific to the odor-evoked activity of the ab3A neurons, as their spontaneous activity is unaffected by NPF knock-down (Fig. 2C).
It is also specific to the ab3A neuronal subclass.
The sensitivity of both ab1A/B and ab2A to EB and methyl acetate (MA), respectively, are unaffected by NPF knock-down (Fig. 2D, E).
Here, we did not sort ab1A spikes from ab1B spikes because the similar amplitudes of both classes of spikes complicate the sorting process.
Although both ab1A and ab1B neurons respond to EB, because ab1A responses to EB are much stronger than ab1B responses, ab1A activity likely dominates the results shown in Fig. 2D.

Since NPF acts via the G protein-coupled NPF Receptor (NPFR) \cite{Garczynski_2002}, we next asked whether loss of NPFR also affects the sensitivity of ab3A neurons to EB.
Indeed, the ab3A neurons of flies carrying homozygous piggyBAC element insertions in the _NPFR_ locus (_NPFR^c01896^_) show significantly lower sensitivity to EB than those of the control _w^1118^_ genetic background (Fig. 2F).
Although Krashes et al. verified _NPFR^c01896^_ as an NPFR hypomorph \cite{Krashes_2009}, for further evidence of NPFR's involvement, we combined _NPFR^c01896^_ with a chromosomal deficiency covering the _NPFR_ locus (_NPFR^Def^_).
As expected, transheterozygous loss of NPFR (_NPFR^c01896^/NPFR^Def^_) produces the same dramatic reduction in ab3A sensitivity to EB compared to the corresponding heterozygous controls (Fig. 2F).
