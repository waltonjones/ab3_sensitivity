Discussion

In mammalian system, NPY production is inhibited by high level of insulin and leptin \cite{Figlewicz_2008}. Although flies do not have leptin, they have several different types of insulin-like peptides (DILPs) \cite{Arquier_2008}, which may inhibit NPF production. DILPs also inhibit the expression of sNPF-R which promote the synaptic transmission in the antennal lobe \cite{Root_2011}. When the fliesâ€™ internal need of energy increases, DILPs level fall leading to loss of inhibition of NPF production in the NPF neurons and sNPF-R expression in the Or22a neurons. Working together, NPF and sNPF signaling amplify the olfactory signal to the higher brain centers and increase the food-searching ability of the flies.

NPF-NPFR signaling may also be regulating other sensory neurons like gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) as well. Drosophila 3rd instar larvae normally show sugar aversion behavior before pupation. However, when NPF is over-expressed, their aversive behavior to sugar is suppressed \cite{Wu_2003}. Since sugar is non-volatile chemical, it has to be recognized by tasting, for which the gustatory receptor neurons are. Given that it looks quite clear NPF is used for modulating the sensitivity of ORNs, it seems reasonable to think NPF is also involved in sensitizing GRNs as well.
