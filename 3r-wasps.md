## NPF-NPFR signaling sensitizes ab3A neurons

In an effort to clarify the mechanism underlying this ab3A modulation, we crossed _386Y-Gal4_, a GAL4 enhancer trap expressed in many peptidergic neurons in the adult fly brain, to several neuropeptide-specific RNAi lines.
We found ab3A neurons depleted of Neuropeptide F (NPF) are significantly less sensitive to EB than heterozygous controls (Fig 2A).
In _Drosophila_, NPF has been implicated in several physiological phenomena including appetite regulation and the modulation of sugar-sensitive gustatory responses \cite{Wu_2003} \cite{Inagaki_2014}.
Consistent with this result, limiting the knock-down of NPF to NPFergic neurons using _NPF-GAL4_, produces an even larger reduction in ab3A sensitivity to EB (Fig 2B). 
This reduction in peripheral olfactory sensitivity is specific to odor-evoked activity, as the spontaneous activity of ab3A neurons is unaffected by NPF knock-down (Fig. 2C).
It is also specific to the ab3A neuronal subclass.
The sensitivity of both ab1A and ab2A to EB and methyl acetate (MA), respectively, are unaffected by NPF knock-down (Fig. 2D, E).

Next, we wondered if the sensitization signal of NPF is transmitted through NPFR, the known NPF receptor. \cite{Garczynski_2002}. 
To address this question, we measured the ab3A neuron's sensitivity of NPFRc01896 hypomorphic mutant flies, which were utilized for the previous research \cite{Krashes_2009}. 
As expected, the sensitivity of ab3A neurons was severely reduced as well by the mutation of NPFR. 
This result suggest that the sensitization signal for ab3A neurons is transmitted through NPFR.
