## NPF-NPFR signaling underlies the sensitization mechanism in ab3A sensitivity

By using transposon-inserted mutants and neuronal Gal4 driven RNAi expressing flies, which are down-regulated for the candidate genes, we have screened and identified the genes that affect ab3A neuron’s sensitivity. Interestingly, among the identified genes, we found that peptidergic neuron-specific knock-down of NPF, which is known to be related with taste and feeding \cite{Wu_2003} \cite{Inagaki_2014}, significantly desensitized ab3A neurons (Fig 2-A). NPF producing neuron-specific knock-down of NPF desensitized ab3A neurons as well (Fig 2-B, E).

To identify the genes that affect ab3A neuron’s sensitivity, we have screened the genes by using transposon-inserted mutants and neuronal Gal4 driven RNAi expressing flies.

By screening transposon-inserted mutants and neuronal-gal4 driven gene knock-down strategies, we found that knock-down of NPF in peptidergic neurons reduce the sensitivity of ab3A neurons (Fig 2-A). We also confirmed this phenotype by using NPF producing neuron-specific Gal4 and NPF RNAi (Fig 2-B, E). 

Out of the results of gene knock-down screenings and preliminary experiments, we found knock-down of NPF, by using NPF RNAi and 386Y-Gal4 pan-peptidergic neuron driver, reduces the sensitivity of Or22a neurons (Fig 2-B).
Again, as expected, knock-down of NPF by using NPF producing neuron-specific NPF-Gal4 driver, also desensitized Or22a neurons as well (Fig 2-C).
Furthermore, prolonged exposure of the female parasitoid wasps, Leptopilina heterotoma, to the female wild-type flies significantly reduced the sensitivity of Or22a neurons (Fig 2-D), which is a consistent result with the previous report that exposing female parasitoid wasps to female fruit flies reduces NPF level in the fly brain \cite{Kacsoh_2013}.
These results clearly demonstrate that down-regulation of NPF in the brain make the Or22a neurons desensitized.
