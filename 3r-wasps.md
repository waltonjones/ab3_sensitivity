## NPF-NPFR signaling underlies the sensitization mechanism in ab3A sensitivity

In previous years, we have identified the genes that affect ab3A neuron's sensitivity by using transposon-inserted mutants and neuronal Gal4 driven RNAi expressing flies. 
Interestingly, we found that peptidergic neuron-specific _386Y-Gal4_ driven knock-down of NPF, which is known to be related with taste and feeding \cite{Wu_2003} \cite{Inagaki_2014}, significantly desensitized ab3A neurons (Fig 2-A). 
Consistently, NPF producing neuron-specific knock-down of NPF desensitized ab3A neurons as well (Fig 2-B, E). 
By the way, knock-down of NPF in the NPF producing neurons elicited specific desensitization of ab3A neurons. 
The quantification result for the sensitivity of all three types of large basiconic sensilla show that knock-down of NPF have no effect on neither ethyl butyrate-sensitive ab1A/B, nor methyl acetate-sensitive ab2A neurons (Fig 2-B, C, D). 
This result suggest that NPF mediate relatively specific sensitization for ab3A neurons.

Next, we wondered if the sensitization signal of NPF is transmitted through NPFR, the known NPF receptor. \cite{Garczynski_2002}. 
To address this question, we measured the ab3A neuron's sensitivity of NPFRc01896 hypomorphic mutant flies, which were utilized for the previous research \cite{Krashes_2009}. 
As expected, the sensitivity of ab3A neurons was severely reduced as well by the mutation of NPFR. 
This result suggest that the sensitization signal for ab3A neurons is transmitted through NPFR.
