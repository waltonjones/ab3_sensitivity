Animal olfactory systems detect thousands of different environmental chemicals at various sensitivity thresholds to improve food and mate seeking and in danger avoidance. Olfactory sensitivity thresholds can also be modulated depending on internal and external cues to adapt odor-guided behaviors to changing conditions. Here, we demonstrate a role in *Drosophila melanogaster* for neuropeptide F (NPF) in the sensitivity modulation of a specific population of antennal olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that detect fruity-smelling esters. Specifically, we show that knock-down of NPF in NPF neurons specifically reduces the sensitivity of Or22a neurons to ethyl butyrate, a volatile ester found in apples and other fruits. Knockdown of the NPF receptor (NPFR) in the Or22a neurons themselves also reduces their sensitivity as well as disrupting the ability of the flies to locate food. In humans, the NPF homologue NPY, plays a critical role in the generation of appetite. Thus, our results demonstrate a conserved peptidergic circuit that not only regulates appetite and food seeking behavior, but, in flies, also modulates the peripheral sensitivity to food odor and the ability of the animals to locate a food source.
