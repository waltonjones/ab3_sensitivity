**Figure 4. The ab3A neurons express NPFR.**

(A) Peak odor-evoked activity of ab3A neurons from _Orco>NPF-IR_ flies and the appropriate heterozygous GAL4 and UAS controls (crossed to _w^1118^_) responding to solvent (paraffin oil, PO) or ethyl butyrate (EB 10^-6^ or 10^-5^ v/v).
(A) Peak odor-evoked activity of ab3A neurons from _Or22a>NPF-IR_ flies and the appropriate heterozygous GAL4 and UAS controls (crossed to _w^1118^_) responding to solvent (paraffin oil, PO) or ethyl butyrate (EB 10^-6^ or 10^-5^ v/v).
The data in A and B are presented as means ± 95% confidence intervals, two-way ANOVA, _P_ ≤ 0.001 (\*\*\*).
(C) Sample traces for ab3 sensilla from the indicated genotypes responding to a 0.5 s stimulation (_black bar_) of ethyl butyrate (EB, 10^-6^ v/v).
(D) A quantification of the results represented in C.
Recordings were performed on 7--11 day-old flies of both sexes.
ab3A neuron-specific expression of _NPFR-RD_ but not _NPFR-RB_using Or22a-GAL4 rescues the reduced EB sensitivity of the _NPFR^c01896^_ mutant.
The data in D are presented as means ± 95% confidence intervals, one-way ANOVA, _P_ ≤ 0.001 (\*\*\*).
