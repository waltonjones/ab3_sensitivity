**Figure 5. NPF-NPFR signaling modulates fly's behavioral attraction to fruit odor via Or22a expressing ab3A neurons**

(A) Schematic drawing of single-fly attraction assay.
(B) Ethyl butyrate (10^-4^ v/v) and fresh apple (10% v/v) juice show almost identical odor response profile by the different types of OSNs.
Data are presented as means ± standard error, n ≥ 3.
(C) The quantified result of single-fly attraction assay.
_w^1118^_ flies are robustly attracted to fresh apple juice, while they are less interested in water.
_Orco^1^_ mutants with non-functional ORNs are not able to locate fresh apple juice.
ab3A neuron-specific knock-down of Or22a receptor disrupt fly's attraction behavior to apple juice.
(D) Knock-down of NPFR in ORNs and in ab3A neurons, by using ORN-specific Orco-Gal4 and Or22a-Gal4 respectively, show significant decrease in attraction to apple juice.
Data for (C, D) are presented as bars with indicated n numbers, Fisher's exact test._
