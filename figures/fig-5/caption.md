**Figure 5. NPFR in ab3A neurons modulates olfactory-guided behavior**

(A) Photo and schematic of the single fly olfactory trap assay.
(B) Ethyl butyrate (10^-4^ v/v) and fresh apple juice (10^-1^ v/v) induce very similar electrophysiological responses in the OSNs of the large antennal basiconic sensilla ab1--ab3.
Odor-evoked responses are presented as means ± standard error, n ≥ 3.
(C) Control experiments validating the single fly olfactory trap assay.
_w^1118^_ flies are robustly attracted to fresh apple juice, but not to water.
_Orco^1^_ mutants, which have defective OR trafficking and severely disrupted odor detection, show only slightly higher attraction to the apple juice bait than _w^1118^_ flies show to water.
Ab3A neuron-specific knock-down of Or22a disrupts attraction to apple juice, as _Or22a>Or22a-IR_ flies are much less successful finding the bait than heterozygous controls (crossed to _w^1118^_).
(D) Knock-down of NPFR in Orco-positive neurons (_Orco-Gal4_) and in ab3A neurons (_Or22a-Gal4_) significantly reduces attraction to apple juice.
The data in C and D are presented as the percentage of flies reaching the bait (i.e., number of successes / number of single fly assays)
P-values were determined with Fisher's exact test, _P_ ≤ 0.05 (\*), _P_ ≤ 0.01 (\*\*), _P_ ≤ 0.001 (\*\*\*).
