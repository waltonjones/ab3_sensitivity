**Figure 4. Sexual dimorphic level of NPF production elicit sensitization of ab3A neurons with different rates between males and females**

(A) The increase of ab3A sensitivity during the early maturation period cannot be accomplished without NPF-NPFR signaling. Odor-evoked responses to ethyl butyrate (EB, 10-6 v/v) in NPFRc01896 and w1118 flies recorded 1, 3, and 7 days post-eclosion. _Data are presented as means ± 95% confidence interval, n≥6, two-way ANOVA, ***P ≤ 0.001._ (B) The higher level of NPF in the male’s brain of the one day-old flies explains the sexually dimorphic ab3A sensitivity during the early maturation period after eclosion. _Whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values, n≥6, t-test, **P ≤ 0.01._
