**Figure 1. The sensitivity of ab3A neurons varies with sex and maturity.**

(A) Sample traces from OR22a-expressing ab3A neurons responding to a 0.5 s stimulation (_black bars_) of water, fresh apple odor, or ethyl butyrate (EB, 10^-5^ v/v).
(B) Peak odor-evoked activity of the ab3A neurons of 13 day-old flies of both sexes responding to water, paraffin oil (_PO_), fresh apple odor, or EB (10^-5^ v/v).
Boxplot whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values, n ≥ 6, One-way ANOVA, _P_ ≤ 0.001 (\*\*\*).
(C) Peak odor-evoked responses of ab3A neurons of male (♂) and female (♀) _w^1118^_ flies to ethyl butyrate (EB, 10^-5^ v/v) as recorded 1, 3, and 7 days post-eclosion.
The data are presented as means ± standard error, n ≥ 6, Two-way ANOVA, ns non-significant, _P_ ≤ 0.05 (\*), _P_ ≤ 0.001 (\*\*\*).
