**Figure 1. The sensitivity of Or22a-expressing ab3A neurons varies according to age and sex.**

(A) Sample traces from OR22a-expressing ab3A neurons responding to a 0.5 s stimulation with water, fresh apple, or ethyl butyrate (EB, 10<sup>-5</sup> v/v).
(B) Peak odor-evoked activity in response to the same odors as (A) recorded in 13 day-old flies of mixed sexes.
Whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values, n ≥ 6, One-way ANOVA, \*\*\* _P_ ≤ 0.001.
(C) The sensitivity of ab3A neurons increases as female flies mature.
Peak odor-evoked responses to ethyl butyrate (EB, 10<sup>-5</sup> v/v) in _w<sup>1118</sup>_ flies recorded 1, 3, and 7 days post-eclosion.
_Data are presented as means ± SEM, n ≥ 6, One-way ANOVA, \* _P_ ≤ 0.05, \*\*\* _P_ ≤ 0.001._
