**Figure 5. NPFR is expressed in Or22a neurons and is involved in sensitizing Or22a neurons**

(A, B) Quantified odor-evoked activities of Or22a-expressing ab3A neurons responding to 10-6, 10-5 (v/v) ethyl butyrate for the NPFR-downregulated flies by ORN-specific Orco-Gal4 and ab3A neuron-specific Or22a-Gal4 drivers. 
_Data are presented as means ± 95% confidence interval, n≥6, two-way ANOVA, \*\*\*P ≤ 0.001._
