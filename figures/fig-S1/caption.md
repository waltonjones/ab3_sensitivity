**Figure S1. Immunostaining confirms NPF depletion in brain NPFergic neurons.**
Brains stained with an NPF-specific antibody show clear NPF-depletion caused in _NPF-G4>NPF-IR_ flies compared to the _NPF-GAL4/+_ and _UAS-NPF-IR/+_ heterozygous controls (_green_).
B staining colored in purple represent synaptic ganglia in the fly brains.
