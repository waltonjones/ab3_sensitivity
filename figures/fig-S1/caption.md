**Figure S1. Immunostaining confirms NPF depletion in brain NPFergic neurons.**

Brains stained with an NPF-specific antibody (_green_) show clear NPF-depletion caused in _NPF-G4>NPF-IR_ flies compared to the _NPF-GAL4/+_ and _UAS-NPF-IR/+_ heterozygous controls.
All brains are counter-stained with the nc82 neuropil marker (_magenta_).
Scale bars, 50 Âµm.
