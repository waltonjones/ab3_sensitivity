**Figure 2. NPF-NPFR signaling sensitizes ab3A neurons.**

(A) Peak odor-evoked activity of ab3A neurons from _386Y>NPF-IR_ flies and the appropriate heterozygous GAL4 and UAS controls (crossed to _w^1118^_) responding to solvent (paraffin oil, PO) or ethyl butyrate (EB 10^-6^ or 10^-5^ v/v).
(B) Peak odor-evoked activity of ab3A neurons from _NPF>NPF-IR_ flies and the appropriate heterozygous GAL4 and UAS controls (crossed to _w^1118^_) responding to solvent (paraffin oil, PO) or ethyl butyrate (EB 10^-6^ or 10^-5^ v/v).
(C) Spontaneous activity of ab3A neurons from _NPF>NPF-IR_ flies and the appropriate heterozygous GAL4 and UAS controls (crossed to _w^1118^_).
Boxplot whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values, n ≥ 6, one-way ANOVA, non-significant (ns).
(D) Peak odor-evoked activity of ab1A/B neurons from _NPF>NPF-IR_ flies and the appropriate heterozygous GAL4 and UAS controls (crossed to _w^1118^_) responding to solvent (paraffin oil, PO) or ethyl butyrate (EB 10^-5^ or 10^-4^ v/v).
(E) Peak odor-evoked activity of ab2A neurons from _NPF>NPF-IR_ flies and the appropriate heterozygous GAL4 and UAS controls (crossed to _w^1118^_) responding to solvent (paraffin oil, PO) or methyl acetate (MA 10^-7^ or 10^-6^ v/v).
(F) Peak odor-evoked activity of ab3A neurons from _w^1118^_, homozygous _NPFR^c01896^_, transheterozygous _NPFR^c01896^/NPFR^Def^_, and the appropriate heterozygous controls (crossed to _w^1118^_) responding to solvent (paraffin oil, PO) or ethyl butyrate (EB 10^-6^ or 10^-5^ v/v).
The data in A--F represent recordings from 7--14 day-old flies of both sexes (n ≥ 6).
The data in A, B, and D--F are presented as means ± 95% confidence intervals, two-way ANOVA, non-significant (ns), _P_ ≤ 0.01 (\*\*), _P_ ≤ 0.001 (\*\*\*).
