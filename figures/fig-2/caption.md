**Figure 2. NPF-NPFR signaling is necessary for sensitizing Or22a-expressing ab3A neurons specifically.**

(A, B) Quantified odor-evoked activities of Or22a-expressing ab3A neurons responding to 10-6, 10-5 (v/v) ethyl butyrate for the NPF-downregulated flies by the peptidergic neuron-specific 386Y-GAL4 driver and the NPF producing neuron-specific NPF-GAL4 respectively.
Flies of mixed sexes were aged for 7-14 days before recordings.
(C, D) Quantified odor-evoked activities of non-ab3 ORNs responding to their compatible odorants, ethyl butyrate and methyl acetate respectively, show no change of sensitivity in NPF-downregulated flies.
(E) NPF immunostaining (green) for the NPF-downregulated flies show absence of NPF in the brains.
(F) The sensitivity of ab3A neurons are decreased by disrupting NPF signal due to ablation of NPF receptor.
Data for (A, B, D, and E) are presented as means ± 95% confidence intervals, n ≥ 6, Two-way ANOVA, \* _P_ ≤ 0.05, \*\*\* _P_ ≤ 0.001.
