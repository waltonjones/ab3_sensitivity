**Figure 2. NPF-NPFR signaling is necessary for sensitizing Or22a-expressing ab3A neurons specifically.**

(A, B) Odor-evoked activity in OR22a-expressing ab3A neurons from _386Y-G4>NPF-IR_ or _NPF-G4>NPF-IR_ flies responding to 0, 10<sup>-6</sup>, or 10<sup>-5</sup> (v/v) ethyl butyrate in paraffin oil.
Flies of mixed sexes were aged for 7--14 days before recordings.
(C, D) Odor-evoked activity in non-ab3 OSNs responding to ethyl butyrate or methyl acetate show no change of sensitivity in NPF-downregulated flies.
(E) NPF immunostaining (green) for the NPF-downregulated flies show absence of NPF in the brains.
(F) The sensitivity of ab3A neurons are decreased by disrupting NPF signal due to ablation of NPF receptor.
Data for (A, B, D, and E) are presented as means ± 95% confidence intervals, n ≥ 6, Two-way ANOVA, \* _P_ ≤ 0.05, \*\*\* _P_ ≤ 0.001.
