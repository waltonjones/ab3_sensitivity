**Figure 4. NPF-NPFR signaling in ab3A neurons modulates behavioral attraction to food odor**

A schematic drawing of the single-fly attraction behavior assay (A). The quantification of the food searching behavior of the wild-type and Orco mutant flies (B). The quantification of the food searching behavior of the NPFR down-regulated flies in the whole ORNs and Or22a neurons respectively (C, D).
