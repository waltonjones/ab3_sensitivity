**Figure 6. NPF-NPFR signaling modulates fly’s behavioral attraction to fruit odor via Or22a expressing ab3A neurons**

(A) Schematic drawing of single-fly attraction assay. (B) Ethyl butyrate and fresh apple juice show almost identical odor response profile by the different types of ORNS. _Data are presented as means ± SEM, n≥3._ (C) The quantified result of single-fly attraction assay. w1118 flies are robustly attracted to fresh apple juice, while they are less interested in water. Orco1 mutants with non-functional ORNs are not able to locate fresh apple juice. ab3A neuron-specific knock-down of Or22a receptor disrupt fly’s attraction behavior to apple juice. (D) Knock-down of NPFR in ORNs and in ab3A neurons, by using ORN-specific Orco-Gal4 and Or22a-Gal4 respectively, show significant decrease in attraction to apple juice. _Data for (C, D) are presented as bars with indicated n numbers, Fisher’s exact test._
