**Figure 6. NPFR may modulate OR22a trafficking but not expression.**

(A) A schematic showing the ab3A neurons soma, inner dendrites, ciliary dilations, and outer dendrites.
Wild-type OR22a staining is indicated in yellow (_Left_).
Representative images of ab3A neurons from _w^1118^_ (_Center_) and _NPFR^c01896^_ (_Right_) stained with an OR22a protein-specific antibody.
Some of the ciliary dilations are marked by open triangles.
These color in these images is inverted to improve visibility.
Scale bar, 5 µm.
(B) Outlining only the outer dendritic segments as regions-of-interest in ImageJ, we found no difference between _w^1118^_ and _NPFR^c01896^_ ab3A neurons in the number of OR22a-stained pixels.
Boxplot whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values, n = 19 sensilla per genotype, Student's t-test, non-significant (ns).
(C) qPCR results show no significant difference in Or22a mRNA expression between _w^1118^_ and _NPFR^c01896^_ heads.
Data are presented as means ± 95% confidence intervals, n = 6, Student's t-test, non-significant (ns).
