**Figure 1. The sensitivity of Or22a-expressing ab3A neurons to the fruity odor ethyl butyrate varies according to age.**

(A) Sample traces from Or22a-expressing ab3A neurons responding to 0.5 s of stimulation with water, fresh apple, and ethyl butyrate (EB) (10<sup>-5</sup> v/v).
(B) Peak odor-evoked activity in response to the same odors as (A) recorded in 13 day-old flies of mixed sexes. Whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values, n≥6, one-way ANOVA, \*\*\*_P_ ≤ 0.001.
(C) The sensitivity of ab3A neurons increases as female flies mature. Peak odor-evoked responses to ethyl butyrate (EB) (10<sup>-5</sup> v/v) in w<sup>1118</sup> flies recorded 1, 3, and 7 days post-eclosion (C). Data are presented as means ± SEM, n≥6, two-way ANOVA, \*_P_ ≤ 0.05, \*\*\*_P_ ≤ 0.001.
