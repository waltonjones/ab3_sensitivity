**Figure 1. Modulation of peripheral olfactory sensitivity to a food-related odor**

The features of the single-sensillum electrophysiological recordings (SSR) for Or22a neurons and other adjacent neurons. Or22a neurons show specific responsiveness to apple odor and ethyl butyrate (EB) (10<sup>-5</sup> v/v) (A). The quantification of change of the Or22a neuron sensitivity in early adult stage after eclosion (B. n ≥ 6, Error bars: 95% CI, *** _P_ ≤ 0.001, statistics: Student's T-test). The quantification of change of Or22a neuron sensitivity after flies are exposed to the parasitoid wasps Leptopilina heterotoma (C).
