**Figure 3. There is no difference in Or22a expression and dendrite trafficking level between NPFR mutant and its control flies**

The quantification result of Or22a mRNA levels comparing between NPFR[PBac] mutants and its control flies show no significant difference. Data are presented as means Â± 95% confidence interval, n=6 triplicates, t-test. (B) The immunostaining for Or22a protein at the sensillar dendrites. (C) The quantified result for stained Or22a protein at the sensillar dendrites show no OR trafficking defect in NPFR mutant. Whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values, n=19, t-test.
