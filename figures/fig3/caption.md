**Figure 5. NPFR is expressed in Or22a neurons and is involved in sensitizing Or22a neurons**

The quantification of the electrophysiological SSR of Or22a neurons for the sensitivity to ethyl butyrate 10-6, 10-5 (v/v) in NPFR-downregulated flies. The olfactory receptor neuron-specific knockdown, Or22a neuron-specific knockdown show decreased sensitivity (A, B). Or22a neuron-specific NPFR rescue recover the sensitivity of the neurons (C). Or22a neuron-specific overexpression of NPFR disrupt the desensitization of Or22a neurons by the parasitic wasp-exposure (D). (A-D. n≥6, Error bars: 95% CI, statistics: 2-way ANOVA, ***P ≤ 0.001)
