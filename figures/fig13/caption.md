**Figure 2. NPF-NPFR signaling is necessary for sensitizing Or22a-expressing ab3A neurons specifically.**

(A, B) Quantified odor-evoked activities of Or22a-expressing ab3A neurons responding to 10-6, 10-5 (v/v) ethyl butyrate for the NPF-downregulated flies by the peptidergic neuron-specific 386Y-GAL4 driver and the NPF producing neuron-specific NPF-GAL4 respectively. Flies of mixed sexes were aged for 7-14 days before recordings. (C, D) Quantified odor-evoked activities of non-ab3 ORNs responding to their compatible odorants, ethyl butyrate and methyl acetate respectively, show no change of sensitivity in NPF-downregulated flies. (E) NPF immunostaining (green) for the NPF-downregulated flies show absence of NPF in the brains. (F) The sensitivity of ab3A neurons are decreased by disrupting NPF signal due to ablation of NPF receptor. _Data for (A, B, D, E) are presented as means ± 95% confidence interval, n≥6, two-way ANOVA, P ≤ 0.05, *P ≤ 0.001._
