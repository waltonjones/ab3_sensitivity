**Figure 2. NPF-NPFR signaling is utilized for sensitizing ab3A Or22a neurons specifically.**

The quantified odor-evoked activities of Or22a-expressing ab3A neurons responding to 10-6, 10-5 (v/v) ethyl butyrate for the NPF-downregulated flies by the peptidergic neuron-specific 386Y-GAL4 (A) and the NPF producing neurons-specific NPF-GAL4 (B) respectively. The 7-14 day-old flies of mixed sexes were used for recordings. (C) NPF immunostaining (green) for the NPF-GAL4 driven NPF-downregulated flies show absence of NPF in their brains. (D) The sensitivity of ab3A neurons are decreased by disrupting NPF signal due to ablation of NPF receptor. (E) The increase of ab3A sensitivity to ethyl butyrate (EB) (10-6 v/v) cannot be accomplished without NPF signaling. Data for (A, B, D, E) are presented as means ± 95% confidence interval, n≥6, two-way ANOVA, *P ≤ 0.05, ***P ≤ 0.001. (F) The higher level of NPF in the male’s brain of the one day-old flies explains the sexually dimorphic ab3A sensitivity of w1118 flies in (E). Whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values, n≥6, t-test, **P ≤ 0.01.Replace this text with your caption
