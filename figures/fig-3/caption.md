**Figure 3. Sexual dimorphisms in NPF-NPFR signaling account for the differential ab3A sensitivity of young males and females.**

(A) Representative images of adult male (♂) and female (♀) brains stained 1 day post-eclosion with an anti-NPF antibody. 
(B) A pixel-based quantification of the NPF staining of male (♂) and female (♀) _w^1118^_ brains 1 day post-eclosion.
Boxplot whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values, n = 6, Student's t-test, _P_ ≤ 0.01 (\*\*).
(C) Peak odor-evoked activity of ab3A neurons from male (♂) and female (♀) _NPFR^c01896^_ and _w^1118^_ flies to ethyl butyrate (EB, 10^-5^ v/v) as recorded 1, 3, and 7 days post-eclosion.
Data are presented as means ± 95% confidence interval, n ≥ 6, two-way ANOVA, _P_ ≤ 0.001 (\*\*\*).
